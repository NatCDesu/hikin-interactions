    **Verdict**
  description: Navia’s signature weapon and Best-in-Slot. Most signature weapons have
    about a 10-15% advantage over other options, but for Navia, there are three competitors
    within about 5% of this weapon. There’s nothing particularly interesting about
    this weapon that will change your playstyle, so just consider it to be a good
    stat stick.

- title: "**Serpent Spine (R5)**"
  description: "Assumes max stacks, which is easy to accomplish in Spiral Abyss. Just
    make Navia the party lead and wait for all the stacks to accumulate before hitting
    start on the floor. Time and time again, Serpent Spine has shown itself to be
    of impeccable value to Claymore-wielders, and even with the new Battle Pass options,
    this reigns supreme over all other 4-star and 5-star options. \n\nMake sure to
    use a CRIT  Rate hat, and not a CRIT DMG hat, since Navia’s CRIT DMG Ascension
    stat compensates for the lack of CRIT DMG Hat. On most other characters, Serpent
    Spine wants a CRIT DMG hat."

- title: "**Redhorn Stonethresher**"
  description: A massive CRIT DMG stat stick with the added bonus of buffing her Normal
    Attacks a small amount. There isn’t much else to say here. 88% CRIT DMG is hard
    to ignore, and the numbers show. This weapon becomes better if you’re using the
    Husk of Opulent Dreams artifact set.

- title: "**Beacon of the Reed Sea (One Passive Trigger)**"
  description: Good due to its CRIT Rate stat and, at minimum, 20% ATK boost. It’s
    important to note that the first Skill does not grant stacks. It has the potential
    to surpass other weapons if she gets hit, but if you’re not perpetually shielded
    with Navia, you have probably done something wrong in your gameplay to drop your
    DPS in other ways.

- title: "**Wolf’s Gravestone / The Unforged**"
  description: Both weapons are more than 10% less than Navia’s signature weapon,
    and both have similar effects. Unforged assumes a shield at all times because
    Navia also wants a shield at all times. If you end up not using Bennett on your
    team, these weapons become much more valuable. Keep in mind that Wolf’s Gravestone
    can buff teammates as well, even if that buff is not reliable.

- title: '**Sacrificial Greatsword / "Ultimate Overlord’s Mega Magic Sword"**'
  description: "These perform slightly better than craftable options, and the event
    weapon is very easy to acquire. If you help all of the Melusines, the 48% ATK
    boost is much appreciated. \n\nAs for Sacrificial Greatsword, its value skyrockets
    if you can somehow get 18 stacks (6 for each Skill) per rotation, but without
    any stacks active, the extra damage is insignificant, as it’s half the motion
    value and can lengthen rotations. Current calculations assume no stacks on the
    3rd Skill use."

    __Craftable Choices__

    **Katsuragikiri Nagamasa / Tidal Shadow**
  description: Tidal Shadow outshines Katsuragikiri if she starts her rotations at
    less than full health, but this is hard to manage on the first floor of Spiral
    Abyss and with Zhongli’s shield. Katsuragiri Nagamasa satisfies most of her Energy
    Recharge requirements while being a more selfish version of a Favonius weapon;
    she gains more energy, but only for herself. Katsuragikiri also buffs Navia’s
    Skill damage, which is much-desired.
