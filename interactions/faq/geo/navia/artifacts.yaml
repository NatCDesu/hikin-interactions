    **4PC Nighttime Whispers in the Echoing Woods**
  description: BiS in practically every team except in a Mono Element team when Navia
    is a sub DPS. It gives a decent amount of Geo DMG Bonus with the condition of
    being shielded by a Crystallize reaction. However, it might not be easy to maintain
    the shield against aggressive enemies because it is somewhat weak, and having
    another shielder in the team doesn’t help since two shields cannot stack on top
    of another (both shields will each take 100% of damage). Although, even if you
    lose the effect for the last few Normal Attacks, this set is still Best-in-Slot.

- title: "**4PC Marechaussee Hunter**"
  description: "Very competitive option with Nighttime Whispers set but Furina is
    required in the team as the only reliable way to drain HP is through Furina’s
    Skill. However, it is not as good as it looks, since you will likely have 0 or
    1 stack of this set for Navia’s first Skill (since stacks can only be gained while
    on-field, and stacks cannot be gained during a Burst animation due to i-frames).
    This is still a very good option, just slightly behind the signature set even
    if we consider this issue, especially if you don’t want to farm the other set.
    \n\nIt is recommended to build less than 64% CRIT Rate to avoid overcapping, but
    it’s better to have more than 55-60% CRIT Rate, because it would be a shame if
    the first E has only 40% CRIT Rate after all."

- title: "**4PC Golden Troupe**"
  description: Good option which is only slightly better than 2pc combos, because
    it buffs the Elemental Skill, which is about 50% of her total DPS (on rotation
    n°2). It is recommended to switch out between the 2 Skills to make sure both get
    the 70% Damage Bonus. If you don’t, it’s only equal or below the 2pc combos. Furthermore,
    make sure to switch out between Burst and Skill to guarantee the 70% Damage Bonus.
    The set is a bit more competitive if you play Navia as a sub DPS, since a significant
    portion of her damage comes from her Skill.

- title: "**2PC Skill/Geo/ATK/ER combos**"
  description: 2pc combos are still a great option if you have good substats and don’t
    want to farm Navia’s signature set. It is about 11-12% weaker than her best set.
    The 2pc combos effects are also unconditional, unlike most 4pc sets. With  Bennett,
    2pc Geo becomes better than 2pc ATK. Without Bennett, the 2pc ATK is better overall.

- title: "**4PC Archaic Petra**"
  description: This option is very competitive (sometimes Best-in-Slot) if you play
    Navia as sub DPS in a Mono Element team. Although Navia loses about 20% of her
    personal damage compared to her best set, it is still usually a gain in overall
    team DPS in teams where Navia’s DPS contribution isn’t high.

- title: "**4PC Gladiator's Finale / 4PC Husk of Opulent Dreams / 4PC Vermillion Hereafter**"
  description: These options are viable, but there is less than 1% difference between
    them and a 2pc combo. They can still be considered if the substats are very good.
    Keep in mind that the Vermillion set is only viable with Furina in the team because
    her drain mechanic is required.
