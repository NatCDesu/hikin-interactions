- title: __ENERGY RECHARGE REQUIREMENTS__
  description: "In teams lacking Favonius weapons, Navia finds herself needing upwards
    of 190% ER. Additionally, due to Navia’s curse of being Geo, she has limited options
    when it comes to generating Geo particles, and her best options rely on Geo constructs
    to create particles, which can break very easily. \n\nIt is strongly recommended
    to use Zhongli as a Favonius holder and funnel the particles to Navia. This is
    easily achieved and ties into her playstyle as it is typical on rotations to use
    Zhongli’s Hold Skill then swap to Navia to activate her Burst. Doing this will
    reduce her ER requirements by 20% to 30%, which is immensely valuable. \n\nBy
    playing in a way that Zhongli’s pillar is not destroyed, you can further reduce
    her ER by another 30%, bringing her to a comfortable ER need of 130%. Nonetheless,
    there are alternatives like using Ningguang or Itto as particle generators, who
    can reliably provide similar levels of Energy as Zhongli’s pillar.\n\nNavia’s
    ER requirements will vary based on your team and rotation. For a more accurate
    estimate, please use the Energy Recharge Calculator linked [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-vkmgp5n0bI9pvhUg110Aza3Emb2puLWdeoCgrxDlu4/copy).\nFor
