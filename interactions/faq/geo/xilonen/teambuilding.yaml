- title: __TEAM BUILDING__
  description: |-
    In short, Xilonen’s role in teams is almost identical to that of Kazuha, minus the 
    AOE damage and Crowd Control, but with the addition of strong healing and the ability 
    to buff the Geo element. She can also be used as a Zhongli replacement when his Shielding 
    capabilities aren’t needed for the interruption resistance since she provides more RES Shred 
    as well as healing to sustain the team. Xilonen is also able to be used as an on-field DPS even 
    at low Constellations, but that will often result in less damage than if she were to be used to buff another carry.

    **__Teammates__**

    <:geo:1150339675546992740> **Geo options:**
    - **Zhongli** - Zhongli is a very strong candidate for the Geo slot, as he brings a strong shield for Geo resonance and universal 20% RES Shred. He can hold 4pc Tenacity of the Millielith or simply 2pc combinations of HP for better Shield Strength.
    - **Albedo** - Albedo is another option for the Geo slot, with solid personal damage and consistent Crystallize and Energy generation. He can be built with 4pc Husk of Opulent Dreams or 4pc Golden Troupe.
    - **Geo MC** - Geo MC is a strong option as a 4*, with high particle generation, a CRIT Rate buff, and solid personal DPS. However, their constructs, especially from skill, can prevent Navia from hitting enemies, whether by covering them in front or raising them up.

    <:flex:1094549077280169984> **The two remaining slots can be any combination of buffers or off-field DPS:**
    - **Furina** - provides a strong buff, but requires a teamwide healer to consistently take advantage of it. She also has some Hydro application which helps generate Crystallize shards, and decent off-field DPS, but she does lengthen rotations. She wants 4pc Golden Troupe.
    - **Kokomi** - serves well as a healer in teams with Furina, brings strong AoE Hydro application for Crystallize, and can carry Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers to help buff Navia. She can hold 4pc Tenacity of the Millielith.
    - **Bennett** - is another option for the healer slot, and brings a large ATK buff of his own, but has very little Pyro application. He can hold 4pc Noblesse Oblige.
    - **Fischl**, **Yae Miko**, **Xiangling**, **Xingqiu**, **Yelan**, **Ganyu**, and **Rosaria** all provide good off-field damage with strong application of their respective elements, which is valuable for Crystallize shields. **Fischl** and **Yae Miko** want 4pc Golden Troupe, Yae in part due to her Burst being a DPS loss. **Xiangling**, **Xingqiu**, **Yelan**, and **Ganyu** want 4pc Emblem of Severed Fate. **Rosaria** wants 4pc Noblesse Oblige.

    Recommended combinations include Bennett-Fischl, Furina-Kokomi, Xingqiu-Yelan, Bennett-Furina, Bennett-Yelan, Fischl-Yelan, FIschl-Yae, Ganyu-Rosaria, and Bennett-Xiangling.

    Quickswap Navia is not recommended because her damage is greatly reduced when played as a quickswap DPS, making her not worth running over other potential options.
