- title: __Analysis__
  description: "- Navia’s kit revolves around using her Burst and Normal Attacks to
    maximize the damage output of her Skill, which is a powerful shotgun blast to
    the face of enemies. Her kit is overall synergistic with many ways to buff her
    own damage. She is also one of the few Geo characters to effectively utilize Crystallize
    reactions even when shielded by someone else like Zhongli, setting a new precedent
    for Geo DPS characters."

    __TALENT OVERVIEW__

    **Normal Attack: Blunt Refusal**
  description: "- Four consecutive strikes; spinning Charged Attack\n\nNavia’s Normal
    and Charged Attacks are buffed by her First Ascension Passive, offering an absolute
    Geo infusion that cannot be overwritten and a large boost to her damage. \n\nThat
    said, since Navia will need to utilize her Normal Attack Talent to maximize her
    kit’s damage output, it’s recommended to level this Talent as high as possible,
    but not before Navia’s Skill."

- title: "**Elemental Skill: Ceremonial Crystalshot**"
  description: "*CD: **9s***\n\n- Gains a stack (6 max) whenever anyone obtains a
    Crystallize shard. On Skill use, she consumes all her stacks to hit the enemy
    a number of times (5-11) based on her stacks (0-3). Each stack beyond the third
    that’s consumed will each buff her Skill DMG by 15%, up to 45% max. Has two uses
    per rotation.\n\nThe bread-and-butter of Navia’s kit. It’s easy to both acquire
    max stacks for each Skill use and hit the enemy with every hit. As a Claymore-wielder
    using Normal Attacks, you’re going to be in point-blank range with your enemy
    anyways. \n\nNavia’s Skill is more than half of her damage output, which makes
    this talent a top priority to maximize."

    *CD: **15s***
    *Energy cost: **60***

    - One initial hit, 17 smaller hits over time. Hits from Burst generate one Crystal Shrapnel stack every 2.4 seconds.

    One of Navia’s primary ways to gain stacks and generate Crystallize shards, which is especially valuable on her Best-in-Slot artifact set, Nighttime Whispers in the Echoing Woods.

    While it offers plenty of utility, it is not an exceptional source of damage output, so this talent can be leveled last.

    __Passives__

    **Ascension 1 Passive: Undisclosed Distribution Channels**
  description: |-
    - For four seconds after using her Skill, the Normal Attack Talent is infused with Geo and cannot be overridden. Additionally, attacks using her Normal Attack Talent gain a 40% DMG Bonus

    This is the main reason to use Navia’s Normal Attacks. Without it, she would have the same boring Normal Attacks as a typical 4-Star Claymore wielder. Most of the time, you’ll be using Normal Attacks.

  description: |-
    - For each Pyro, Electro, Hydro, Or Cryo character in your party, Navia gains 20% ATK, maxing out at 40% (two different elements).

    Another incentive to pair Navia with other non-Geo characters, which is recommended in order to maximize Crystallize generation.

    - 20% more rewards on Fontaine expeditions.

    You should probably just mine for ore instead, but there may be a non-zero number of cases where this comes in handy.
