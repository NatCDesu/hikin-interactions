    > *For 8s after triggering either follow-up effect of the Passive Talent "Tailor-Made," when your current active character's Normal, Charged, or Plunging Attacks hit a nearby opponent, a simplified automaton doll, "Kinu," will be summoned near this opponent. You can summon 1 Kinu every 1s in this way, and up to 3 Kinu may be summoned this way during each instance of "Tailor-Made"'s Seize the Moment or Tailoring effect. The above effect can be triggered up to once every 15s.
    > Must unlock the Passive Talent "Tailor-Made" first.*

    Introduces a new set of Kinu dolls which can be triggered in the same way Tapestry coordinated attacks are triggered. Only 3 Kinu can be summoned at a 1s interval, which disappear after dealing damage.
