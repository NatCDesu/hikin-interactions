    __TALENT PRIORITY__

    **Elemental Skill > Elemental Burst > Normal Attack**
  description: |-
    ## __Analysis__
    - Chiori’s kit is centered around her Elemental Skill, making it her highest-priority Talent to level. Her Burst is not to be completely neglected, especially at higher Constellations, although it is still not recommended to build Energy Recharge unless you have Constellation 2 unlocked. Lastly, Normal Attacks are disappointing. Despite having a Geo infusion, the numbers aren’t gratifying, and it is inadvisable to use them unless Constellation 6 is active.
