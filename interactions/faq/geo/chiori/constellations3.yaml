    Increases Elemental Burst Talent Level by 3. This is not as useful since Chiori’s Burst is not an important component of her damage. Nevertheless, since Constellation 2 is activated at this point, you’ll be incentivized to use her Burst more.

    > *After triggering a follow-up effect of the Passive Talent "Tailor-Made," Chiori's own Fluttering Hasode's CD is decreased by 12s. Must unlock the Passive "Tailor-Made" first.
    > In addition, the DMG dealt by Chiori's own Normal Attacks is increased by an amount equal to 235% of her own DEF.*

    Allows Chiori to change her playstyle and become an on-field DPS. With the newly received buffs, her Normal Attacks become significantly more relevant, allowing for a more noticeable presence in both damage and field time. Additionally, the cooldown reduction on the Skill allows Chiori to cast her Skill twice consecutively at a 4s interval which can be efficiently filled by using Normal Attacks.
