    **Uraku Misugiri**
  description: Signature weapon and Best-in-Slot for Chiori, about 15% superior to
    her next best option. It offers an enormous amount of CRIT DMG while buffing DEF,
    Skill, and Normal Attack damage. Chiori’s ideal teams also allow her to easily
    maintain full uptime on the passive.

- title: "**Primordial Jade Cutter**"
  description: A sword from early-game that has somehow resisted years of power creep.
    Even though Chiori does not build HP, the massive CRIT Rate stat is highly desirable,
    and the ATK bonus based on Max HP is simply a pleasant bonus. At R5, Jade Cutter
    surpasses Cinnabar Spindle.

- title: "**Wolf-Fang**"
  description: A Battle Pass-only weapon that offers a gratifying amount of CRIT Rate
    when using the equipped character’s Skill and a pleasant ATK boost.
