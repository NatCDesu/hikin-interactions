  description: An event-only weapon that serves as Albedo’s signature weapon. If you
    don’t have this weapon now, it’s unlikely you’ll get another chance. Its DEF-scaling
    passive and DEF% stat are an enormous boon to Chiori’s performance.

  description: |-
    This 3-star weapon is a safe choice for off-field sword-wielding DPS characters, as they don’t often get hit. Without its passive, the weapon falls far behind in damage, but you’re still getting a good deal out of a freely accessible weapon.

    Be careful with this weapon when using Furina and/or Bennett, as it will be difficult to keep Chiori’s HP topped off unless you have a dedicated healer (that heals beyond 70% HP).

- title: "**Honorable Mentions**"
  description: Light of Foliar Incision and Haran Geppaku Futsu are great weapons
    for Chiori and keep up with the weapons mentioned above, although it is preferred
    to use them on other units as Chiori herself cannot take full advantage of their
    passives.
