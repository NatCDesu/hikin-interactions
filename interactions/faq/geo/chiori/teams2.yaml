- title: "**Ningguang Teams**"
  description: "### Chiori | Ningguang | Flex | Flex\nThis team allows for a short
    17s rotation, thanks to the short cooldowns of team members. It is also the first
    team to feature Ningguang in a competitive light in recent memory. Ningguang acts
    as the on-field DPS, while Chiori deals damage from the backline. The flex slots
    are used for characters that either amplify team damage or deal respectable damage
    on their own. \n\nIt’s worth noting that Chiori’s DPS in this team is roughly
    equal to Mono Geo, making this option one of Chiori’s better teams.\n\n__**Teammates**__\n\n<:flex:1094549077280169984>
    **Flex options:** Furina, Fischl, Bennett, Xiangling, Yelan, Xingqiu, Zhongli"

    ### Chiori | Navia | PECH Flex | PECH Flex
    Navia, at first glance, is a strange choice to pair with Chiori, as Navia is one of the few Geo characters who cannot create constructs to enable Chiori’s second Tamoto doll. Nevertheless, so long as there are two other Pyro, Electro, Cryo, or Hydro teammates, Navia will be able to maximize her own damage. Chiori’s off-field performance contributes to Elemental Shard generation and still-respectable damage to the team. Perhaps the most important benefit Chiori provides to Navia is her reliable Geo Particle generation, which helps with Navia’s high ER needs.
