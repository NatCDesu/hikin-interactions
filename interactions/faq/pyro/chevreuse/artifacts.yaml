    If players require the use of Chevreuse’s Elemental Burst, her ER Requirements should be met first before looking for other stats. Chevreuse prefers to stack as much HP% as possible, helping her to reach 40,000 HP to maximize her A4 Passive. After that, she is able to focus on other stats that benefit her healing, such as a Healing Bonus Circlet. In Raiden teams, Chevreuse’s ER Requirements are low enough that she can aim for more offensive substats, such as CRIT and ATK%.

    **Substats:** ER% until requirement (if Bursting) > HP until ~40,000 > HB%  > HP% > Flat HP

    __Artifact Sets__

    **4PC Song of Days Past**
  description: 4pc Song of Days Past is a new artifact set releasing in 4.3, granting
    five instances of Flat DMG Bonus to the on-field character based on the total
    healing recorded after 6 seconds. This effect works the same way as Shenhe’s Icy
    Quill effect, resulting in the additive stacks being used up quicker in AoE compared
    to single-target. On top of this, other characters may accidentally use up these
    stacks during a rotation if it triggers during their field time. However, Chevreuse
    is able to max out the set’s effect with her C6 and can be a viable alternative
    in some teams already running other supportive sets. For players ignoring her
    Elemental Burst, Chevreuse can max out this set’s effect twice in a rotation,
    due to the increased healing from additional HP and Healing Bonus stats.

- title: "**4PC Noblesse Oblige**"
  description: 4pc Noblesse Oblige further increases the buffs Chevreuse grants, providing
    a 20% ATK buff to the party, although it requires building ER% for her Elemental
    Burst.

- title: "**4PC Maiden Beloved**"
  description: 4pc Maiden Beloved Further increases Chevreuse’s healing, granting
    the team an extra 20% Incoming Healing Bonus after she casts her Elemental Skill
    or Burst.

- title: "**4PC Ocean-Hued Clam**"
  description: 4pc Ocean-Hued Clam can be considered for some extra damage when building
    for Chevreuse’s healing. Although she doesn’t max out the Sea-Dyed Foam, it deals
    an equal amount of damage in AoE, compared to Song of Days Past being more single-target
    oriented.

- title: "**4PC Tenacity of the Millelith**"
  description: 4pc Tenacity of the Millelith increases Chevreuse’s healing with its
    20% HP (2pc effect), whilst also granting a short teamwide 20% ATK buff upon hitting
    an enemy with her Skill. TotM can be considered when running Chevreuse with teammates
    who are able to quickly snapshot the 4pc effect.

- title: "**2pc HB/HP/ER combos**"
  description: 2pc combinations of Maiden Beloved, Ocean-Hued Clam, Song of Days Past,
    Tenacity of the Millelith, Vourukasha’s Glow and Emblem of Severed Fate will generally
    provide higher healing than the aforementioned 4pc set bonuses (outside of 4pc
    Maiden Beloved), but lack the extra team utility.
