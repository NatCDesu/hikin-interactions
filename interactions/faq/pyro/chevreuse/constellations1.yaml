      > *When the active character with the "Coordinated Tactics" status (not including Chevreuse herself) triggers the Overloaded reaction, they will recover 6 Energy. This effect can be triggered once every 10s.
      > You must first unlock the Passive Talent "Vanguard's Coordinated Tactics."*

      Although this Constellation may look good on paper, in reality it’s difficult to control which characters trigger Overloaded and when, requiring near-perfect timing to proc this effect twice for a typical 20-second rotation. Although it may help some characters, the Energy provided from this Constellation is not to be relied on, but treated as an extra bonus for the on-field character that receives this effect.

      > *After Holding Short-Range Rapid Interdiction Fire and hitting a target, 2 chain explosions will be triggered near the location where said target is hit. Each explosion deals Pyro DMG equal to 120% of Chevreuse's ATK. This effect can be triggered up to once every 10s, and DMG dealt this way is considered Elemental Skill DMG.*

      After Chevreuse uses her Hold Skill, her bullet will explode into two smaller explosions with inward knockback, applying an extra instance of Pyro and dealing Pyro DMG. Unfortunately, her personal damage isn’t particularly high, leading to this Constellation being quite underwhelming. However, the two extra hits can be useful to trigger effects such as Favonius Lance’s passive.
