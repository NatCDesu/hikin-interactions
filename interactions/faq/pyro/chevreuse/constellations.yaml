    between both damage and healing-oriented builds. Although their increases are
    similar, please check the [Chevreuse Mastersheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c8CZOoCWtLpKbHqJCCSpnL32ijBF8aCfbKuDfpliry4/edit?usp=sharing)

    > *When the active character with the "Coordinated Tactics" status (not including Chevreuse herself) triggers the Overloaded reaction, they will recover 6 Energy. This effect can be triggered once every 10s.
    > You must first unlock the Passive Talent "Vanguard's Coordinated Tactics."*

    Although this Constellation may look good on paper, in reality it’s difficult to control which characters trigger Overloaded and when, requiring near-perfect timing to proc this effect twice for a typical 20-second rotation. Although it may help some characters, the Energy provided from this Constellation is not to be relied on, but treated as an extra bonus for the on-field character that receives this effect.

    > *After Holding Short-Range Rapid Interdiction Fire and hitting a target, 2 chain explosions will be triggered near the location where said target is hit. Each explosion deals Pyro DMG equal to 120% of Chevreuse's ATK. This effect can be triggered up to once every 10s, and DMG dealt this way is considered Elemental Skill DMG.*

    After Chevreuse uses her Hold Skill, her bullet will explode into two smaller explosions with inward knockback, applying an extra instance of Pyro and dealing Pyro DMG. Unfortunately, her personal damage isn’t particularly high, leading to this Constellation being quite underwhelming. However, the two extra hits can be useful to trigger effects such as Favonius Lance’s passive.

    > *After using Ring of Bursting Grenades, the Hold mode of Short-Range Rapid Interdiction Fire will not go on cooldown when Chevreuse uses it. This effect is removed after Short-Range Rapid Interdiction Fire has been fired twice using Hold or after 6s.*

    After casting her Elemental Burst, Chevreuse is granted the ability to use her Hold Skill an extra two times, allowing up to three quick and consecutive Skill casts. Unfortunately, these extra Skill uses don’t generate particles due to her 10-second cooldown on particle generation. Additionally, this Constellation doesn’t reset her Skill’s cooldown, meaning Chevreuse will be unable to use her C4 if she uses her Skill before her Burst. However, according to current information, if players use her Burst before her Skill but don’t want to use the two Skill uses from her C4, the 6 second duration on her C4’s effect will delay her Skill’s 15-second cooldown, effectively making it 21 seconds. This forces players to quickly use all three of Chevreuse’s Skills, taking up field time, whilst removing the possibility to use her C4 to gain two sets of particles in a 25-second rotation. If it turns out that her C4 doesn’t extend her Skill’s cooldown, it is possible for Chevreuse to cast her Burst and 1 Skill early in a rotation, then come back 10 seconds later for another Skill cast, allowing for her to generate up to 8 particles per rotation. While only a few rotations can actually accommodate this, those that can may find it helpful to funnel the extra particles to another teammate. As it is currently unclear whether this will be changed on release, it is worth keeping in mind.

    > *After 12s of the healing effect from Short-Range Rapid Interdiction Fire, all nearby party members recover HP equivalent to 10% of Chevreuse's Max HP once.
    > After a party member is healed by Short-Range Rapid Interdiction Fire, they gain a 20% Pyro DMG Bonus and Electro DMG Bonus for 8s. Max 3 stacks. Each stack's duration is counted independently.*

    Chevreuse’s C6 provides a 20% DMG Bonus to any characters she heals, stacking up to 3 times for a maximum of 60% Pyro and Electro DMG Bonus. This effect can take some time to stack up due to her slow healing intervals but is a potent buff for any Chevreuse team. Additionally, after 12 seconds of healing from her Skill, Chevreuse heals the entire party, helping for extra survivability and granting them a stack of her DMG Bonus buff, increasing the team’s overall damage output further. Keep in mind, the results here are for personal damage, the teamwide damage increase is ~10% overall.
