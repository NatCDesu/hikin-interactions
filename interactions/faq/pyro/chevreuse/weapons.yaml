    **Black Tassel**
  description: Chevreuse’s weapon of choice for maximizing both her healing and her
    buffing, allowing her to run both a Healing Bonus Circlet and Energy Recharge
    Sands if players want to consistently use her Burst. Being a 3-star weapon also
    makes it extremely affordable for all players.

- title: "**Favonius Lance**"
  description: Favonius weapons are generally a good choice on any supportive teammate,
    helping to lower all party member’s ER Requirements. This can also help Chevreuse
    to Burst more frequently whilst focusing fully on HP substats to improve her healing.

- title: "**Rightful Reward**"
  description: A craftable weapon from Fontaine, providing HP% from its substat and
    flat Energy upon being healed. With C6’s teamwide healing, Chevreuse is guaranteed
    to trigger this once per rotation, due to the weapon passive working off-field,
    lowering her ER Requirements and allowing her to run a Healing Bonus Circlet.
    However, a C0 Chevreuse may struggle to trigger this without a secondary healer,
    due to her Elemental Skill’s healing being slightly delayed after casting. For
    players who don’t care for Chevreuse’s Burst, this weapon provides much less HP%
    than Black Tassel, making it weaker across the board.

- title: "**Any other HP or ER Polearm**"
  description: Any weapon that provides Chevreuse with HP% or Energy Recharge can
    be useful to help her reach ~40,000 HP to maximize her buff, whilst being able
    to Burst every rotation. However, ER% weapons outside of Favonius Lance become
    useless when not utilizing Chevreuse’s Burst, shrinking her total number of available
    weapons.

- title: "**Staff of Homa**"
  description: An offensive weapon choice that provides a small amount of HP% to help
    with Chevreuse’s healing and buffing. Its passive also converts HP into ATK for
    the wielder, increasing Chevreuse’s damage on a support-oriented build, or increasing
    her supportive capabilities when built for damage. Keep in mind, this weapon doesn’t
    provide any Energy Recharge, meaning players will need to gain ER% elsewhere for
    her to consistently Burst in an offensive scenario.
