- title: "**Song of Broken Pines**"
  description: Despite its Physical DMG% substat, Song of Broken Pines is still a
    decent option on Gaming for its high Base ATK and ATK% passive. It also provides
    an ATK% team buff if Gaming uses at least four Normal Attacks, which may allow
    teammates to deal more damage. It loses value if you use Gaming with a unit that
    can infuse his Normal Attacks. It also loses value in Xianyun teams if Gaming
    uses Plunging Attacks instead of Normal Attacks during his downtime.

- title: "**Talking Stick**"
  description: "**Talking Stick is always a downgrade to Serpent Spine**, so it’s
    not recommended to get Talking Stick from the Battle Pass. That said, if you already
    have Talking Stick, it’s a decent option for Gaming because he can at least guarantee
    half of the passive by imbuing himself with Pyro.  Even if you can somehow guarantee
    the other half of the passive, it still performs worse than Serpent Spine."

- title: "**Skyward Pride**"
  description: Skyward Pride’s value largely depends on Gaming’s ER Requirements.
    In teams with Bennett, they’re often low enough for Skyward to lose some value.
    Gaming’s C4 also reduces his ER Requirements, which subsequently makes this weapon
    lose even more value. That said, even with lower ER needs, it’s still a weapon
    with high Base ATK, unconditional DMG%, and some mild Physical damage procs from
    the passive.

- title: "**Mailed Flower**"
  description: An event exclusive weapon that gives high amounts of EM and ATK%. It
    does lose the buff on one of Gaming’s Plunging Attacks which causes it to lose
    a small amount of value, but it’s still a great weapon for those who obtained
    it.
