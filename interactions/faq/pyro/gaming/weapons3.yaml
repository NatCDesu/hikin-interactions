- title: "**Lithic Blade**"
  description: Since Gaming is a Liyue character, this weapon is guaranteed to have
    at least one stack. The average assumption for Lithic Blade is that you have at
    least two stacks, otherwise it's not recommended to use this weapon. The ATK%
    is decent, but pales in comparison to the CRIT Rate% it gives. This weapon scales
    well with refinements, which can be seen as a downside because of Lithic Blade’s
    exclusivity to the weapon banner.

- title: "**Tidal Shadow**"
  description: A F2P craftable weapon that requires being healed in exchange for a
    massive ATK% buff. Gaming heals himself upon using a Plunging Attack, so he can
    easily maintain the passive. However, since Bennett and Xianyun are common teammates
    for Gaming teams, the value of this ATK% buff is diminished. Tidal Shadow sees
    higher value if used in teams that give Gaming large amounts of DMG%.

- title: '**"Ultimate Overlord’s Mega Magic Sword"**'
  description: A decent alternative to Tidal Shadow for those who obtained it in the
    recent 4.3 event. Ultimate Overlord’s Mega Magic Sword’s value largely depends
    on Gaming’s ER Requirements. In teams with Bennett, these are typically low enough
    for this weapon to lose some value. Gaming’s C4 also reduces his ER Requirements,
    which subsequently makes this weapon lose value.
