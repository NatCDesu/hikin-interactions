    __TALENT OVERVIEW__

    **Normal Attack: Stellar Rend**
  description: Gaming’s Normal and Plunging Attacks are often used in between his
    Charmed Cloudstrider Plunging Attacks. Regular Plunging Attacks are used when
    Xianyun is in the team to maximize her A4 Passive. Hence, it is not recommended
    to fully ignore this Talent.

    *CD: **6s***

    The crème de la crème of Gaming’s kit and the source of most of his damage. Gaming lunges forward and launches himself upwards after colliding with an enemy. Upon going down, he performs his special Charmed Cloudstrider Plunging Attack, which is a Pyro-converted Plunging Attack that cannot be overridden by other infusions. Gaming also consumes 15% of his Max HP upon landing a Charmed Cloudstrider Plunging Attack. This consumption stops when only 10% of his Max HP remains. Charmed Cloudstrider Plunging Attacks cannot deal Collision Plunge Damage.

- title: "**Elemental Burst: Suanni's Gilded Dance**"
  description: "*CD: **15s***\n*Energy cost: **60***\n\nGaming enters Wushou Stance
    upon using his Burst. During its initial cast, Gaming regains 30% of his Max HP,
    briefly applies Pyro to himself, and summons his companion, Suanni Man Chai, who
    smashes into the enemy and deals damage. Man Chai then rolls to a nearby location
    and collides with Gaming. After colliding, Gaming’s Elemental Skill CD resets.
    \n\nIf Gaming performs a Charmed Cloudstrider Plunging Attack whilst above 50%
    HP during the Wushou Stance, he summons Man Chai again, who rolls and collides
    with Gaming once more. This resets his Skill CD again and allows him to do Charmed
    Cloudstrider Plunges 4–5 times within Wushou Stance’s duration."
