- title: "**4PC Gilded Dreams**"
  description: Gilded Dreams is a viable set to run on Gaming as it is only ~5% worse
    than both Crimson Witch and Marechaussee Hunter. Similar to Crimson Witch, Gilded
    Dreams benefits more from being used in a Vaporize/Melt team due to the EM that
    the set gives. Outside of reaction-heavy teams, Marechaussee Hunter becomes much
    more consistent.

- title: "**2PC ATK% / EM / DMG%**"
  description: 2pc combinations are usable as an alternative to the above sets if
    you are still farming for a 4pc set. Simply aim for enough ER along with as much
    CRIT and EM as you can muster.

- title: "**4PC Vermillion Hereafter**"
  description: Vermillion Hereafter may seem to be a viable alternative to use on
    Gaming due to his HP drain, however due to Gaming’s synergy with Bennett, this
    set actually performs considerably worse than other 4pc sets. Furthermore, Vermillion
    Hereafter only performs slightly better than 2pc combinations for Gaming. Generally
    only use this set if you have really favorable substats; otherwise, use the aforementioned
    4pc sets or a 2pc/2pc combination.
