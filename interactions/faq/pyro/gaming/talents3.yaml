    **Ascension 1 Passive: Dance of Amity**
  description: This Passive allows Gaming to heal himself outside of his Burst’s initial
    cast. For 0.8s, he recovers 1.5% of his HP per 0.2s, which means he heals 6% of
    his HP total for 0.8s after hitting an opponent with his Charmed Cloudstrider
    Plunging Attack.
