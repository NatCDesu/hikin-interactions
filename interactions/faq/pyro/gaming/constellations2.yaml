    Notably lowers Gaming’s ER Requirements (to be discussed further in the next section), allowing more leeway for offensive substats to increase his damage output.

    An increase on Gaming’s Burst level. His Burst is not a significant portion of his overall damage output, but an increase is still welcome nonetheless.

    > *Bestial Ascent's Plunging Attack: Charmed Cloudstrider CRIT Rate increased by 20% and CRIT DMG increased by 40%, and its attack radius will be increased.*

    Gaming’s strongest Constellation. His Charmed Cloudstrider Plunging Attacks gain a notable CRIT buff, which increases its damage by roughly 31%. Charmed Cloudstrider Plunging Attacks also gain an attack radius increase from 4m to 6m, which makes its AoE the same size as Bennett’s Burst radius.
