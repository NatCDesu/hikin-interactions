- description: "## __Analysis__\n- Gaming’s kit revolves around his Charmed Cloudstrider
    Plunging Attacks; hence, his Elemental Skill should be prioritized in leveling.
    The Wushou Stance granted by his Burst helps him perform these enhanced Plunging
    Attacks in rapid succession. These enhanced Plunging Attacks cannot deal Collision
    Plunge Damage. \n- With C6 Bennett and Xianyun, Gaming’s Normal Attacks and regular
    Plunging Attacks contribute notably to his damage output due to Xianyun’s Plunging
    Attack buffs and C6 Bennett’s Pyro infusion, along with a 15% Pyro DMG Bonus.
    Therefore, in such teams, it is recommended to level his Normal Attack Talent
    as well.\n- Gaming has a HP fluctuation mechanic similar to Fontaine characters,
    consuming and recovering his own HP upon using his Skill. It is recommended to
    keep him above 50% HP as much as possible to fully maximize his self-buffs and
    Man Chai’s Elemental Skill CD reset."
