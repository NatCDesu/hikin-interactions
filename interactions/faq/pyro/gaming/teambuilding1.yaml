    **Bennett**
  description: Bennett is a particularly important teammate for Gaming for multiple
    reasons. Not only are the ATK buff and healing from Bennett’s Burst useful — the
    former for obvious reasons and the latter to help Gaming maintain his DMG Bonus
    from his A4 Passive — but with C6 Bennett, Gaming gains a Pyro infusion on his
    Plunging Attacks, allowing him to trigger more reactions, increasing his damage
    significantly. Bennett’s Burst does have the issue of being tied to a fixed area,
    which can be limiting with regards to Gaming’s gameplay, which involves dashing
    towards enemies before doing Plunging Attacks. This is, however, less of an issue
    in fights with heavy enemies in single-target scenarios, or if Xianyun is on the
    team since you can opt to execute normal Plunging Attacks instead. Generally,
    it’s highly preferred to have Benentt on Gaming teams.
