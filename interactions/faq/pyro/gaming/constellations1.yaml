    __CONSTELLATIONS__

    **Constellation 1 - Bringer of Blessing**
  description: |-
    > *When the Suanni Man Chai from Suanni's Gilded Dance meets back up with Gaming, it will heal 15% of Gaming's HP.*

    Gaming gains even more self-healing outside of his Burst’s initial cast and his A1 Passive, which aids in keeping him above 50% HP. Unfortunately, this Constellation doesn’t really do anything to directly increase his own damage.

  description: |-
    > *When Gaming receives healing and this instance of healing overflows, his ATK will be increased by 20% for 5s.*

    Gaming buffs himself for any instance of overhealing he receives, adding a little more value to his self-healing and other healers.

- title: "**Constellation 3 - Awakening Spirit**"
  description: |-
    > *Increases the Level of Bestial Ascent by 3.
    > Maximum upgrade level is 15.*

    An increase on Gaming’s Elemental Skill level, which in turn, is a welcome increase on his Charmed Cloudstrider Plunging Attack’s damage.
