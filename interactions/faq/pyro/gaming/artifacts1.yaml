    EM Sands is preferred due to Gaming’s reliance on Vaporize/Melt. Nevertheless, ATK% Sands can be viable with better substats or within Overload/Mono teams.

    **Substats:** ER until requirement > CRIT DMG = CRIT Rate > EM > ATK%

    __Artifact Sets__

    **4PC Marechaussee Hunter**
  description: This is Gaming’s BiS set both with and without Furina. Whilst he does
    not get the most usage out of the 2pc effect, he is able to consistently obtain
    all 3 stacks of the 4pc effect quickly. This allows Gaming wider weapon options
    and less reliance on a lot of CRIT substats. It is highly recommended to not build
    above 64% CRIT Rate to avoid overcapping.

- title: "**4PC Crimson Witch of Flames**"
  description: Crimson Witch of Flames is tied with Marechaussee Hunter for Gaming’s
    BiS set within Vaporize/Melt teams due to the reaction bonus the set provides.
    Gaming is able to build stacks of the 4pc effect over a rotation as a result of
    his Elemental Burst resetting the cooldown of his Elemental Skill. However, it
    is recommended to farm Marechaussee Hunter due to it not being reliant on reactions
    to get value.
