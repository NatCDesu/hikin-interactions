  description: Dashing to meet Man Chai would maximize the amount of Charmed Cloudstrider
    Plunges Gaming is able to use. Due to the insufficient amount of Cryo application,
    focusing on Charmed Cloudstrider Plunge's Melt damage would be more optimal instead
    of weaving in any regular Plunging Attacks or Normal Attacks.

  description: To deal as much damage as possible while waiting for Gaming's Elemental
    Skill CD, weave Normal Attacks in between Charmed Cloudstrider Plunges.
