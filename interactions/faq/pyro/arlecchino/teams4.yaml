  description: "### Arlecchino | Bennett | Anemo/Flex | Flex\nMono Pyro compositions
    focus on increasing non-reaction damage, by taking advantage of increasing Pyro
    particle generation across the team to lower ER requirements and Pyro RES Shred
    from 4pc Viridescent Venerer. Bennett is a staple in the team, as he provides
    Pyro particles and substantially boosts Arlecchino’s damage through his powerful
    ATK buff.\n\n__**Teammates**__\n\n<:anemo:1094545726748508250> **Anemo options:**\n-
    **Kazuha**: On top of holding 4pc Viridescent Venerer, Kazuha provides grouping
    and a Pyro DMG% Bonus. \n- **Sucrose/Heizou**: As Catalyst users, both Sucrose
    and Heizou can equip Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers to provide an ATK% buff
    for Arlecchino, as well as the Pyro RES Shred from 4pc Viridescent Venerer.\n-
    **Lynette**: Lynette can provide a small ATK% buff in addition to holding 4pc
    Viridescent Venerer.\n\n<:flex:1094549077280169984> **Flex options:**\n- **Zhongli**:
    Zhongli’s hefty shield provides universal RES Shred, and creates for a more comfortable
    and safe gameplay experience. He can also hold 4pc Archaic Petra to buff Arlecchino’s
    Pyro DMG%, although collecting the Crystallize Shards necessary to obtain the
    buff can be difficult. \n- **Chiori**: Without C1, Chiori needs a Geo Construct
    to maximize her Skill damage, so she is best paired with Zhongli, where she can
    take advantage of his Skill’s Stone Stele and Geo Resonance to deal substantial
    off-field damage. Said Geo Resonance also provides Arlecchino a 15% DMG Bonus.
    \n- **Xiangling**: Xiangling snapshots Bennett’s ATK buff onto her Burst to deal
    substantial off-field damage. She benefits both from Pyro RES Shred from an Anemo
    unit holding 4pc Viridescent Venerer, and from reduced ER requirements thanks
    to the combined Pyro particle generation of 3 Pyro units.\n- **Yun Jin**: Arlecchino’s
    reliance on Normal Attacks to deal much of her damage allows her to take advantage
    of Yun Jin’s Normal Attack-specific buffs."
