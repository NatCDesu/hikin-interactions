  description: "### Arlecchino | Chevreuse | Electro | Flex\nChevreuse’s potent buffs
    — enabled exclusively by compositions of only Pyro and Electro characters — allow
    Arlecchino’s Overloaded teams to deal high amounts of primarily raw damage. Players
    can choose a high-risk, high-reward playstyle by exchanging defensive units for
    significantly higher damage, although safer team compositions can be fairly strong
    as well. As Overloaded may knock lighter enemies out of Bennett’s circle, Overloaded
    teams are most effective against heavy enemies.\n\n__**Teammates**__\n\n<:electro:1094545575992623115>
    **Electro options:**\n- **Fischl**: Fischl offers significant single-target damage,
    high particle generation, and consistent Electro application to trigger Chevreuse’s
    buffs, all while requiring little field time. She is a strong candidate for Arlecchino’s
    Overloaded teams. \n- **Yae**: Yae can be run by herself in a similar role as
    Fischl, although she generates fewer particles and occupies more field time than
    Fischl. Alternatively, she can be run alongside Fischl in the Flex position to
    provide additional off-field damage. It is typically not worth the setup and field
    time to cast Yae’s Burst in Arlecchino teams.\n\n<:flex:1094549077280169984> **Flex
    options:**\n- **Bennett**: As described in his section above, Bennett provides
    a powerful ATK buff for Arlecchino, as well as Fischl and/or Beidou if they are
    on the team.\n- **Thoma/C4 Yanfei/Dehya**: Thoma, C4 Yanfei, and Dehya provide
    shields or damage mitigation, and interruption resistance. Running a defensive
    unit can make playing Arlecchino a more comfortable experience. \n- **Xiangling/Beidou**:
    Xiangling and Beidou both can take advantage of Chevreuse’s buffs and offer significant
    off-field damage. Beidou also provides substantial damage reduction and interruption
    resistance — as well as a small shield at C1 — that makes her an effective defensive
    option. Due to the nature of her Burst, Beidou’s effectiveness is reduced greatly
    in single-target scenarios."
