    Arlecchino’s Burst is not especially important for her damage, so the increase here is negligible; almost non-existent. This is because Arlecchino only uses her Burst once every other rotation anyways. With C4 in-hand, maybe an once-per-rotation Burst can be squeezed in, but even then, this is probably her weakest Constellation.

    > *The DMG of Balemoon Rising is increased by Arlecchino's ATK multiplied by 700% of Arlecchino's current Life Bond percentage.
    > For 20s after Arlecchino uses All Is Ash, both her Normal Attacks and Elemental Burst gain 10% increased CRIT Rate and 70% increased CRIT DMG. This effect can be triggered up to once every 15s.*

    A massive 90 CV added onto Arlecchino plus a greater multiplier based on Bond of Life is nothing to sneeze at. It’s unfortunate that you have to go through C4 and C5 to get this Constellation.  Skill → Burst now becomes a powerful tool to instantly clear a wave in certain Abyss layouts.
