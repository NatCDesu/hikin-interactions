  description: "### Arlecchino | Hydro | Flex | Flex\nArlecchino’s Vaporize teams
    typically focus on amplifying her damage through Vaporize and other buffs. Only
    Yelan and Xingqiu provide the Hydro application necessary for Arlecchino to consistently
    Vaporize her attacks. The other two slots are more flexible, offering an assortment
    of buffs, personal damage, and/or defensive utility depending on the characters.\n\n__**Teammates**__\n\n<:hydro:1094545501493403709>
    **Hydro options:**\n- **Yelan**: Yelan provides consistent off-field Hydro application,
    excellent single-target personal damage, and a ramping DMG% buff. \n- **Xingqiu**:
    Xingqiu plays the same role as Yelan, but he offers a substantial amount of interruption
    resistance instead of a buff. He can also be run alongside Yelan in one of the
    Flex slots, where he and Yelan will provide Hydro Particles for each other.\n\n<:flex:1094549077280169984>
    **Flex options:**\n- **Bennett**: As described in his section above, Bennett’s
    powerful ATK buff increases Arlecchino’s damage significantly.\n- **Sucrose/Kazuha**:
    Sucrose and Kazuha can both hold 4pc Viridescent Venerer to reduce enemy Pyro
    RES, and provide grouping and their own potent buffs, with Sucrose buffing team
    EM and holding Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers, and Kazuha buffing Elemental
    DMG%.\n- **Fischl/Yae**: Fischl and Yae both provide significant personal damage,
    high particle generation, and off-field Electro application, allowing Arlecchino
    to trigger Overloaded. Note that Yae does not typically Burst in Arlecchino teams.\n-
    **Zhongli/Layla/Diona**: Zhongli, Layla, and Diona are all viable shielders for
    Arlecchino’s Vaporize teams who can increase her survivability and comfort of
    gameplay. Zhongli additionally provides universal RES Shred, while Diona and especially
    Layla can allow Arlecchino to occasionally Melt her attacks on Freezable enemies.
    Note that Diona and Layla can actually reduce Arlecchino’s Vaporize count on enemies
    that are not Freezable.\n- **Xianyun**: Xianyun enables a Plunging Attack playstyle
    wherein Arlecchino weaves Plunging Attacks that are amplified by Vaporize and
    Xianyun’s buffs into her attack sequence, creating the potential for significant
    AoE damage. Although Furina is typically not recommended for Arlecchino teams
    due to her inability to provide consistent Hydro application and anti-synergistic
    mechanics, she can be worth running in Xianyun teams, alongside either Yelan or
    Xingqiu.\n- **Chiori**: Without C1, Chiori needs a Geo Construct to maximize her
    Skill damage, so she is best paired with Zhongli, where she can take advantage
    of his Skill’s Stone Stele and Geo Resonance to deal substantial off-field damage.
    Said Geo Resonance also provides Arlecchino a 15% DMG Bonus. \n- **Yun Jin**:
    Arlecchino’s reliance on Normal Attacks to deal much of her damage allows her
    to take advantage of Yun Jin’s Normal Attack-specific buffs."
