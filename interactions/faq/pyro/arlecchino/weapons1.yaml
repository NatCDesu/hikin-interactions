    **Crimson Moon’s Semblance**
  description: One of the best signature weapons *for its designated character* we’ve
    seen in a while, being more than 15% above the next best option at the same refinement,
    whether you use her in Vaporize teams or Overloaded teams. It’s disappointing
    that the weapon will rarely be the best choice for a non-Arlecchino character.
    Not recommended as a general-use pull, but certainly recommended for Arlecchino
    if you can spare the Primogems, as it also grants more healing due to high ATK
    and extra Bond of Life. All other R5 5-star weapons are worse than Crimson Moon’s
    R1 performance, though C1 provides the greater damage boost if you had to choose
    only one.

- title: "**Primordial Jade-Winged Spear / Staff of Homa (Below 50% Max HP)**"
  description: "Jade Spear is great for Arlecchino due to its synergy with rapid Normal
    Attacks and a generically strong standard banner 5-star weapon thanks to its CRIT
    Rate stat and high Base ATK, the latter of which allows greater healing for comfort.
    \n\nR1 Homa surpasses this weapon only when you can keep Arlecchino below 50%
    Max HP. It’s assumed here that Arlecchino will not consistently be under 50% HP.
    When Above 50% HP, R1 Homa is comparable to R5 Deathmatch."

- title: "**Staff of the Scarlet Sands (Vaporize)**"
  description: A comfortable choice when building CRIT Rate on artifacts proves to
    be challenging. In Overloaded teams, it is within 1% of Primordial Jade-Winged
    Spear, but just under 3% better than it in Vaporize teams when using EM Sands.

- title: "**Deathmatch R5 (General Single-Target) / Ballad of the Fjords R5 (Where
    EM Matters)**"
  description: Deathmatch (at any refinement), in Overloaded teams, is the only legitimate
    4-star weapon option for Arlecchino and surpasses some 5-star options as well.
    Ballad of the Fjords excels in teams where EM matters, so long as you can maintain
    its 3-element requirement. Deathmatch assumes single-target scenarios in all calcs.
