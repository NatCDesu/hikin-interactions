    __TALENT OVERVIEW__

    **Normal Attack: Invitation to a Beheading**
  description: |-
    Arlecchino’s Normal Attacks have a bit more to them than other characters. Upon obtaining a Bond of Life equal or greater than 30% of her Max HP, she will enter the Masque of the Red Death state, converting her attacks to Pyro and enhancing her Normal Attack’s damage based on her current Bond of Life. When hitting enemies with Normal Attacks, she will consume 7.5% of her current Bond of Life. Additionally, each Normal Attack hit will reduce her Elemental Skill’s cooldown by 0.8s, allowing her to reliably use her Skill every rotation without relying on her Burst to reset its cooldown.

    Additionally, holding her Charged Attack for longer allows her to glide swiftly along the ground for 5s at the cost of Stamina. With this, Arlecchino can float across water and up mountains with ease, aiding in exploration.

    *CD: **30s***

    Her Elemental Skill sends out spikes in front of her before dashing to an enemy with a cleave, dealing AoE Pyro DMG. Enemies hit by her Elemental Skill will be marked by a Blood-Debt Directive, dealing damage up to 2 times every 5s. Upon using her Charged Attack or Elemental Burst, Arlecchino will absorb any nearby Blood-Debts from enemies, gaining 65% Bond of Life for each Blood-Debt absorbed, up to a maximum of 145% per Skill cast. Although her Skill doesn’t do much damage by itself, it is the crux of Arlecchino’s kit, allowing her to gain massive amounts of Bond of Life. It also generates 5 Pyro Particles with a 30s cooldown, although this cooldown will be a lot shorter in reality with her Normal Attack’s ability to reduce her Skill cooldown.

    *CD: **15s***
    *Energy cost: **60***

    Arlecchino’s Elemental Burst deals damage in an AoE in front of her, whilst absorbing any nearby Blood-Debts to heal her based on her current Bond of Life and ATK. Although her Burst absorbs nearby Blood-Debts to grant her Bond of Life, her healing first cleanses her current Bond of Life before actually healing her, meaning it can not be used as an alternative to her Charged Attack. Thankfully, her Burst also resets her Elemental Skill’s cooldown, allowing her to still gain Bond of Life in a rotation, alongside an additional 5 Pyro Particles. Although it contains her only source of survivability, its long cast time and low damage result in it not being a meaningful ability for damage, and it should generally only be cast when needing to heal. For players that can ignore her Elemental Burst, this will result in pre-existing Bond of Life being carried through to her next rotation, increasing the damage dealt by her Normal Attacks.
