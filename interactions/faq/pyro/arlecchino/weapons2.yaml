- title: "**Deathmatch R5 (General Single-Target) / Ballad of the Fjords R5 (Where
    EM Matters)**"
  description: Deathmatch (at any refinement), in Overloaded teams, is the only legitimate
    4-star weapon option for Arlecchino and surpasses some 5-star options as well.
    Ballad of the Fjords excels in teams where EM matters, so long as you can maintain
    its 3-element requirement. Deathmatch assumes single-target scenarios in all calcs.

- title: "**Calamity Queller**"
  description: |-
    Arlecchino is off-field for just long enough to gain the full stacks she needs from Calamity Queller to compete with other options. It will rarely be the best choice *for your account* to use Calamity Queller over lower refinements of Deathmatch or R5 White Tassel, since the CRIT stats on Deathmatch and White Tassel make artifact farming much easier.

    Vortex Vanquisher is slightly worse than this when constantly shielded, but when unshielded, even White Tassel is a better option.

- title: "**White Tassel R5 or Deathmatch R1**"
  description: White Tassel, a 3-star weapon, is stronger than every 4-star weapon
    besides Deathmatch and, in Vaporize teams, Ballad of the Fjords. White Tassel’s
    damage is 2% (Vaporize) and 4% (Overloaded) lower than R1 Deathmatch in single-target
    scenarios, and Deathmatch requires swiping for Battle Pass. White Tassel’s effects
    are straightforward, give CRIT Rate to make artifact farming easier, and synergizes
    with Arlecchino’s Normal Attack-heavy playstyle. White Tassel, however, falls
    off significantly if you are not within Bennett’s Burst circle.
