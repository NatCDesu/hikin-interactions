    **Bennett**
  description: Bennett is a particularly notable teammate for Arlecchino, providing
    an incredibly powerful ATK buff for Arlecchino and other teammates who can snapshot,
    which greatly increases the damage output of Arlecchino and her team. The difference
    in damage between having and not having Bennett’s buff cannot be understated;
    while Arlecchino teams can be effective even without him, the majority of her
    strongest teams — in every team archetype — feature him. His one major drawback
    is that his buff is limited to the stationary circle of his Burst’s range.
