    **4pc Fragment of Harmonic Whimsy**
  description: A hyper-specific artifact set, meaning the main character you’re going
    to be farming this for is Arlecchino. It is roughly 5%+ better than 4pc Gladiator’s
    Finale.

- title: "**4pc Gladiator’s Finale**"
  description: If you’ve been playing Genshin Impact for a long time, you are bound
    to have a good number of strong Gladiator pieces laying around, since they drop
    from nearly every Boss fight in the game. Its emphasis on buffing Normal Attacks
    is particularly good for Arlecchino.

- title: 2pc Pyro DMG%/ATK%/EM (Vaporize) Combinations
  description: Pyro DMG% will go further for Arlecchino than ATK% and EM 2pc bonuses
    will, but the differences between these sets are so small that you should probably just go with the
    2pc combinations with the best substats. These combinations are roughly 10%+ less
    effective than Harmonic Whimsy.
