    Arlecchino loves using her Normal Attacks, so this is a potent Constellation for her. The DPS increase that results from this is about what would be expected of a typical Constellation.

    Purely a quality-of-life Constellation. This makes it more feasible to Burst every rotation when you need the extra healing. There is no actual damage increase from this, and even if using her Burst every rotation becomes viable, her Burst does not contribute significantly to her damage profile.

    If you choose to Burst every rotation, this is actually a roughly 0.2% *decrease* in DPS, but this decrease is so insignificant that the extra survivability is still useful.
