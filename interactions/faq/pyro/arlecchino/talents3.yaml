    **Ascension 1 Passive: Agony Alone May Be Repaid**
  description: 5s after a Blood-Debt Directive is applied to an enemy, it will upgrade
    to a Blood-Debt Due. Upon absorbing a Blood-Debt Due, it will instead grant Arlecchino
    130% Bond of Life. Additionally, once an enemy with a Blood-Debt dies, Arlecchino
    will immediately gain 130% Bond of Life. As a result of this, Arlecchino’s rotations
    will generally involve her using her Skill to apply her Blood-Debts, then swapping
    out until it has upgraded, where she will then swap back in to absorb it with
    a Charged Attack. Thankfully, enemies dying whilst Arlecchino is off-field will
    still grant her Bond of Life due to this Passive’s secondary effect, however,
    it is still bound by the 145% maximum Bond of Life instated by her Skill.

- title: "**Ascension 4 Passive: Strength Alone Can Defend**"
  description: For every 100 ATK over 1000, Arlecchino will gain 1% Resistance to
    both Elemental and Physical DMG, up to a maximum of 20%. Despite helping with
    her survivability, this Passive generally won’t help considerably in keeping players
    alive. Furthermore, she is unable to realistically cap out this Passive without
    the help of Bennett, which allows her to easily reach over 3000 ATK.

- title: "**Utility Passive: The Balemoon Alone May Know**"
  description: Rather than a general Utility Passive, Arlecchino instead sacrifices
    her ability to receive healing from teammates in exchange for an extra 40% Pyro
    DMG Bonus. This allows her to be used alongside healers without losing any Bond
    of Life which would decrease her overall damage. This Passive also only works
    during combat, allowing players in the Overworld to heal her freely if they dislike
    not being at full HP.
