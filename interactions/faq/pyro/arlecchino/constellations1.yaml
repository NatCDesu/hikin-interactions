    **Constellation 1 - "All Reprisals and Arrears Are Mine to Bear..."**
  description: |-
    > *Masque of the Red Death is further enhanced, the value of the increase is 100%. Additionally, Arlecchino's interruption resistance is increased when she performs Normal Attacks while affected by the Masque of the Red Death.*

      A humongous buff to Arlecchino’s damage, outperforming the difference between her signature weapon and the next best option. C1 is a high priority regardless of what team composition Arlecchino is used in. She also gains full interruption resistance for her Normal and Charged attacks, meaning they cannot be interrupted. Keep in mind that this effect is only active while she is attacking and leaves her vulnerable while moving.

    > *Blood-Debt Directives are now already Blood-Debt Due when first applied.
    > When Arlecchino absorbs such a Due, she unleashes Balemoon Bloodfire in front of her, dealing 900% of her ATK as AoE Pyro DMG. This effect can trigger once every 10s.
    > You must first unlock the Passive Talent "Agony Alone May Be Repaid."*

      A minor DPS increase. Roughly 8% is still potent, but it feels a bit underwhelming compared to R1. Can reduce the DPS loss of having to urgently heal during her rotation since Burst is no longer locked to specific windows. The additional 20% Resistance on top of her A4 Passive also helps to make Arlecchino quite tanky, reducing the impact of taking damage during her rotations.
