    CRIT\n\nArlecchino’s build style is straightforward. Simply build as much CRIT
    as possible while maintaining a 1:2 ratio between CRIT Rate and CRIT DMG, then
    build ATK% if you don’t intend to use Amplifying Reactions for damage, otherwise
    use EM. \n\nEven in Vaporize playstyles, ATK% and EM are comparable, though EM
    remains the better choice overall until you exceed 150 EM. Between ATK% and EM,
    in these cases, go for the best substats if you don’t want to keep farming.\n\n**Substats:**
    CRIT% > ATK%"
