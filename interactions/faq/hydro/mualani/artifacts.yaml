    With the new artifact set, 4pc Obsidian Codex, Mualani gains 40% CRIT Rate by just consuming Nightsoul points. Combined with her CRIT Rate Ascension Passive, she already effectively has more than 60% CRIT Rate, therefore it is very easy to overcap it.

    **Substats:** CRIT > HP% > EM

    **4pc Obsidian Codex**
  description: The new Natlan artifact set is definitely the Best-in-Slot set for
    Mualani, providing her with 40% CRIT Rate for basically the full uptime of her
    Skill and Burst. Note that for this set, you generally want to use a CRIT DMG
    Circlet to avoid overcapping your CRIT Rate.

  description: Mualani can make use of the Hydro and Normal Attack DMG% Bonus. A bit
    better than 2pc combos.
