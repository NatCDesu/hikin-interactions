    A straightforward damage increase. This Constellation increases the Talent Level of her Skill resulting in higher buff multipliers for her Sharky’s Surging Bites.

    > *Mualani regenerates 8 Energy when obtaining a Puffer. Must first unlock the Passive Talent "Heat-Resistant Freshwater Floater."
    > Additionally, Boomsharka-laka deals 75% increased DMG.*

    Mualani doesn’t require building a lot of Energy Recharge since her Burst overall is minor in damage contribution compared to her buffed Normal Attacks. Not recommended to pull for this Constellation specifically.
