- title: "**Tome of the Eternal Flow**"
  description: Neuvillette’s Signature Weapon. Another massive CRITstick while providing
    a bit of HP, but the secondary passive is non-existent for Mualani. Not recommended
    to pull specifically for her, but is still better than The Widsith if you have
    it.

- title: "**The Widsith / Ring of Yaxche R5**"
  description: The first of the non-premium / BP options, The Widsith along with the
    Ring of Yaxche both fare decently on paper for Mualani, with The Widsith coming
    out on top ever so slightly. One thing to note though is that with The Widsith,
    only two of the three buffs are actually useful for Mualani, with the Recitative
    buff providing ATK% being completely useless for her damage. Hence, if you wish
    for her damage to be more consistent, you might want to consider favoring the
    Ring of Yaxche, which is not only craftable, but you can also obtain it immediately
    after logging into the game in Version 5.0 as a collective reward from a Web Event.

- title: "**Ash-Graven Drinking Horn R5**"
  description: The 5.0 flagship event weapon. On paper, this weapon performs similarly
    to Ring of Yaxche R1, so if you have no billets to spare for refining the Ring
    of Yaxche and need a weapon for Mualani, you can run with the Ash-Graven Drinking
    Horn, which you should be able to max out by playing the 5.0 event.
