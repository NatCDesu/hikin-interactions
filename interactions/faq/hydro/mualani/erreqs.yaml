- title: __ENERGY RECHARGE REQUIREMENTS__
  description: |-
    Mualani does not want to build ER since it’s better to focus on offensive stats, as it is not really worth Bursting every rotation, especially at the current time of writing where Mualani cannot utilize her Ascension 4 Passive well. At C4, she already has enough ER within KQMS to Burst every rotation by picking up her Puffer. For the players that do want to Burst every rotation, the tools below will help calculate the ER requirement based on the situation.

    Mualani’s ER requirements will vary based on your team and rotation. For a more accurate estimate, please use the Energy Recharge Calculator linked [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-vkmgp5n0bI9pvhUg110Aza3Emb2puLWdeoCgrxDlu4/copy).
