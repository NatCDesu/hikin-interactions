    __TALENT OVERVIEW__

    **Normal Attack: Cooling Treatment**
  description: This Talent is irrelevant to her kit, despite her Sharky’s Bite being
    considered as Normal Attack DMG, since Sharky’s Bite is upgraded through leveling
    up her Elemental Skill. Her Normal Attack should only be used to set up the rotation
    through applying Hydro.

- title: "**Elemental Skill: Surfshark Wavebreaker**"
  description: "*CD: **6s***\n\nMualani gains 60 Nightsoul points and enters Nightsoul's
    Blessing state, which consumes Nightsoul points until they are depleted or when
    the Skill is used again. In this state, she moves around on her Surfboard, and
    upon hitting an enemy, it will not deal damage, but instead mark that enemy as
    Prey and give Mualani 1 Wave Momentum stack, up to 3 stacks. 1 stack can be gained
    from the same enemy every 0.7s. \n\nEach Wave Momentum stack will increase the
    damage of her Enhanced Normal Attack – Sharky’s Bite. At 3 stacks, the Sharky
    Bite’s MV will be further increased and become Sharky’s Surging Bite. After performing
    a Normal Attack, the mark will be removed, and Mualani will fire Shark Missiles
    at up to 5 nearby Prey, dealing Sharky's Bite Nightsoul-aligned DMG and clearing
    the stack. If there is more than one target for either the Sharky’s Bite or Shark
    Missiles, the damage will be reduced, by 14% at 2 targets, up to 28% at 3+ targets.\n\nIt
    is recommended to always use Sharky’s Bite at full stacks (indicated by a bar
    on the screen), not only for the larger damage, but it also extends the Nightsoul's
    Blessing through her Ascension 1 Passive, which will be explained in its own section."

- title: "**Elemental Burst: Boomsharka-laka**"
  description: |-
    *CD: **15s***
    *Energy cost: **60***

    Mualani’s Elemental Burst simply deals a strong Nightsoul-aligned hit that scales with her HP.
