    **Surf’s Up**
  description: Mualani’s Signature Weapon. Surf’s Up is a fantastic weapon that offers
    Mualani everything she needs. Aside from a whopping 88.2% CDMG from leveling it
    to Level 90, it also gives her 20% HP passively, as well as up to 48% Normal Attack
    DMG at 4 stacks of Scorching Summer, which helps boost her damage even further.
    If Mualani is being played in a Forward Vaporize team, she will easily maintain
    her maximum stacks on the weapon, since the loss in stacks after an Normal Attack
    is counteracted by the gain in a stack from triggering a Vaporize reaction. Hence,
    if you wish to pull for her weapon, it is advised that you build a team focused
    around the Forward Vaporize reaction to get maximum yield from it.

  description: A very powerful option even at R1, this Battle Pass weapon also provides
    plenty of stats desirable to Mualani, giving her up to 64% HP and 80 EM for 10s
    after taking the field on top of a very noticeable 36.8% CR. If you don’t intend
    to go for her sig, this is her second best option at R5, and is better than every
    other 4-star option even at R1. The main caveat here is that with this weapon,
    you might find it difficult to optimally gear her up when factoring in 4pc Obsidian
    Codex as well as her CR% ascension, which puts her at an effective **101%** CR
    before factoring in anything else. Hence, when it comes to Mualani’s best artifact
    set with this weapon, CR% is essentially a dead stat, meaning that Mualani only
    has CDMG%, HP%, EM and HP as desirable stats now.

- title: "**A Thousand Floating Dreams**"
  description: Nahida’s Signature Weapon. Since Mualani’s team is likely going to
    comprise at least 2 team members that have differing elements, she will get 2
    DMG stacks from this weapon, which is a helpful contributing factor to her damage.
    Furthermore, since her favored playstyle is Forward Vaporize, having such a huge
    burst of EM from the weapon really boosts her damage, making this weapon a surprisingly
    good option if you have it on hand and are not using it on anybody else. Would
    not recommend pulling this weapon specifically for Mualani though.
