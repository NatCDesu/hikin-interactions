    __CONSTELLATIONS__

    **Constellation 1 - The Leisurely "Meztli"...**
  description: |-
    > *The DMG dealt by the first Sharky's Surging Bite after Mualani enters Nightsoul's Blessing and the Shark Missiles it triggers is increased by 66% of Mualani's Max HP. This instance of increased DMG is subject to the diminishing DMG rules of Surfshark Wavebreaker.
    > In addition, while out of combat, Mualani's Nightsoul's Blessing state consumes 30% less Phlogiston and Nightsoul points.*

    Mualani’s first Constellation increases the damage of her first enhanced Normal Attack with 3 Wave Momentum stacks and Missiles, resulting in a noticeable damage increase. This is a valuable early Constellation and a good stopping point for F2P or low spenders. C1 will also aid Mualani in exploring Natlan by decreasing her Phlogiston consumption, allowing her to swim over liquid longer.

  description: |-
    > *Mualani gains 2 of Surfshark Wavebreaker's Wave Momentum stacks when she enters Nightsoul's Blessing state. She will gain 1 stack when obtaining a Puffer.
    > In addition, whenever Mualani obtains 2 Puffers within a single instance of the Nightsoul's Blessing state, she will recover an additional 12 Nightsoul points over 2s. This effect requires the Passive Talent "Heat-Resistant Freshwater Floater" to be unlocked first.*

    Another good Constellation that allows Mualani to perform 4 instances of Sharky's Surging Bites per Skill use.
