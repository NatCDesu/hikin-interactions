    **Ascension 1 Passive: Heat-Resistant Freshwater Floater**
  description: When Sharky's Surging Bite (3 stacks Sharky’s Bite) hits an enemy,
    a Puffer will be generated nearby, generating up to 2 Puffers per instance of
    Nightsoul's Blessing. Each Puffer, when picked up, will restore 20 Nightsoul points
    to Mualani. This will ensure Mualani can consistently get up to 3 Sharky’s Surging
    Bites per Skill in a single-target scenario.

  description: "When a nearby party member triggers a Nightsoul Burst (a mechanic
    wherein a Nightsoul Burst will be triggered if your party contains a character
    from Natlan and a character deals Elemental DMG to an opponent), Mualani will
    store 1 stack of Wavechaser's Exploits for 20 seconds, max 3 stacks. The stacks
    will be consumed when Mualani uses her Burst, increasing its DMG. \n\nAt the current
    time of writing, it is not recommended to stack multiple Natlan characters in
    the team for the shorter cooldowns of Nightsoul Burst (Kinich, Kachina) due to
    the lack of synergy between them."

    This is a special passive for Natlan characters, including Mualani, when they are exploring in Natlan. After her Nightsoul points are depleted, to maintain her Nightsoul's Blessing, Mualani will switch to consume Phlogiston, a special stamina bar that appears above the character’s HP bar exclusive to Natlan characters. Switching to Mualani while the active character is sprinting, swimming, moving due to certain Talents, or at a certain height within an area with Phlogiston Mechanics will cause her to enter in her Nightsoul’s Blessing state, gaining 40 Nightsoul points alongside it. This effect can be triggered once every 10s.

    When Mualani surfs across water or Liquid Phlogiston in Natlan in her Nightsoul’s Blessing state, her Nightsoul point or Phlogiston consumption decreases by 75%. Outside of Natlan, her Nightsoul point consumption decreases by 35% instead.

  description: Mualani’s Utility Passive displays the location of Natlan’s local specialties
    on the mini-map, aiding in material farming for Natlan characters. Aside from
    that, whenever Mualani picks harvestable items in an area with Phlogiston Mechanics
    within Natlan, she restores 15 Phlogiston.
