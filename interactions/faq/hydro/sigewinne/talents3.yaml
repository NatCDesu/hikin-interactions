    **Ascension 1 Passive: Requires Appropriate Rest**
  description: After using her Skill, Sigewinne gains 8% Hydro DMG Bonus and 10 stacks
    of Convalescence that lasts for 18s. Convalescence stacks are consumed when teammates’
    off-field Elemental Skills deal damage. Upon consuming a stack, Sigewinne grants
    Additive DMG Bonus to off-field Elemental Skills. The Additive DMG Bonus Sigewinne
    grants is based on her Max HP. For every 1000 HP she has that exceeds 30000 HP,
    she gives 80 Flat DMG, capping at 2800.
