    **Furina**
  description: Sigewinne’s healing, A1 buff, and Hydro particles make her a strong
    pairing for Furina across her teams. As a duo they offer strong off-field damage,
    a DMG% buff, comfortable healing, and Hydro application.

  description: "### Sigewinne | Furina | Pyro | Flex\nA strong Pyro applier allows
    Furina and Sigewinne to Vaporize. Vaporize further amplifies Sigewinne’s A1 passive.\n\n__**Teammates**__\n\n<:pyro:1085111476584460328>
    **Pyro options:**\n- **Klee:** She offers on-field Pyro application. Her A4 passive
    reduces team ER requirements. Be careful that her Skill mines do not steal Sigewinne’s
    A1 stacks. \n- **Xiangling:** She offers off-field AoE Pyro application. She can
    run with Bennett for her own personal damage or a buffer to further amplify Furina.\n\n<:flex:1094549077280169984>
    **Flex options:**\n- **Kazuha:** His DMG% buff, ability to hold 4pc Viridescent
    Venerer (VV), and grouping are invaluable. The premier Anemo option.\n- **Sucrose:**
    A 4-star alternative to Kazuha who does not fall far behind. She can hold TTDS
    to buff Xiangling or Klee.\n- **Other Anemo Characters:** Although worse than
    Kazuha and Sucrose, these characters are still able to increase team damage through
    4pc VV and come with their own utility.\n- **Bennett:** Increases the damage of
    your Pyro character, although he does not buff your Hydro characters. Greatly
    lowers Xiangling’s ER requirements."
