    **Furina**
  description: Sigewinne’s healing, A1 buff, and Hydro particles make her a strong
    pairing for Furina across her teams. As a duo they offer strong off-field damage,
    a DMG% buff, comfortable healing, and Hydro application.

    ### Sigewinne | Furina | Pyro | Flex
    A strong Pyro applier allows Furina and Sigewinne to Vaporize. Vaporize further amplifies Sigewinne’s A1 passive.

    __**Teammates**__

    <:pyro:1085111476584460328> **Pyro options:**
    - **Klee:** She offers on-field Pyro application. Her A4 passive reduces team ER requirements. Be careful that the mines from her Skill, Jumpty Dumpty, do not steal Sigewinne’s A1 stacks.
    - **Xiangling:** She offers off-field AoE Pyro application. She can run with Bennett for her own personal damage.

    <:flex:1094549077280169984> **Flex options:**
    - **Kazuha:** His DMG% buff, ability to hold 4pc Viridescent Venerer (VV), and grouping are invaluable. The premier Anemo option.
    - **Sucrose:** A 4-star alternative to Kazuha who does not fall far behind. She can hold TTDS to buff Xiangling or Klee.
    - **Other Anemo Characters:** Although worse than Kazuha and Sucrose, these characters are still able to increase team damage through 4pc VV and come with their own utility.
    - **Bennett:** Increases the damage of your Pyro character, although he does not buff your Hydro characters. Greatly lowers Xiangling’s ER requirements.
