    **Silvershower Heartstrings**
  description: Sigewinne’s signature and best weapon. The high HP% from the secondary
    benefits both her personal damage and A1 buff. The Elemental Burst CRIT Rate buff
    further increases Sigewinne’s damage. Sigewinne needs to pick up her Sourcewater
    Droplets to get the full passive.

- title: "**Elegy for the End**"
  description: A very strong option when the buff is useful and Sigewinne uses her
    Burst. Sigewinne quickly triggers the passive with her Burst, but takes some time
    to trigger when only her Skill is used.

- title: "**Aqua Simulacra**"
  description: A strong option for Sigewinne’s personal damage; it loses a lot of
    value when she does not use her Burst, as the CRIT DMG does not benefit her A1
    buff. May be better used on another character.

- title: "**Recurve Bow**"
  description: Sigewinne’s best F2P weapon, and better than all other unlisted weapons
    due to its HP% substat.

- title: "**Favonius Warbow**"
  description: Significantly worse than other bows for Sigewinne’s buff and personal
    damage, but the extra energy it offers can outweigh those cons. The Energy Recharge
    substat and passive usually more than satisfy her Energy Recharge requirements.
