    __TALENT PRIORITY__

    **Elemental Skill > Elemental Burst >> Normal Attack**
  description: |-
    ## __Analysis__
    - Sigewinne’s Elemental Skill is recommended to be prioritized since it provides damage, and most importantly, healing for the team. Her Burst is also recommended to be leveled, albeit not at the same priority as her Skill, since it provides additional damage output for Sigewinne to fill in downtimes within rotations. Her Normal Attack Talent does not contribute to her kit, therefore leveling it is optional.
