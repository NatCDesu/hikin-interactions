    ### Sigewinne | Nilou | Dendro | Dendro/Hydro
    Sigewinne’s strong healing helps offset Bloom self damage in Nilou Bloom teams. Her low Hydro application means she prefers Triple Hydro teams. In Double Hydro teams she can on-field with her Burst, but its short duration holds her back.

    __**Teammates**__

    <:hydro:1094545501493403709> **Hydro options:**
    - **Furina:** Again, Furina is a strong Hydro option. However, she is not dominant here as she is in other teams due to her lower Hydro application and Bloom’s lack of scaling on DMG%.
    - **Yelan/Xingqiu:** Their Bursts contribute strong off-field Hydro application. Yelan should try for a 2 Skill rotation.

    <:dendro:1094441547170316359> **Dendro options:**
    - **Nahida:** She boasts very strong Dendro application to drive Triple Hydro teams.
    - **Alhaitham:**  His on-field Dendro application makes him a great driver. His higher personal damage than Nahida makes better use of Furina.
    - **Dendro Traveler/Collei:** They do not have enough Dendro application to efficiently on-field Triple Dendro teams, but they are strong options for Double Dendro teams.

  description: |-
    ### Sigewinne | Dendro | Electro/Pyro | Hydro/Flex
    Although Sigewinne’s Hydro application can not enable Hyperbloom or Burgeon on her own, she can support a second Hydro character and provide healing. As the only Hydro character, her low Hydro application allows Quicken to be maintained while she provides healing and her A1 buff.
