  description: "### Sigewinne | Hydro/Electro | Electro | Kazuha\nElectro-Charged
    \ teams rely on the strong personal damage of off-field Electro and Hydro units.
    An Anemo character can deal high reaction damage through Swirling Electro-Charged
    enemies. The lower field time requirements on teammates allow Sigewinne to have
    time for her Burst. The team can be a quickswap team consisting of many off-field
    units or one with a dedicated on-fielder.\n\n__**Teammates**__\n\n<:hydro:1094545501493403709>
    **Hydro options:**\n- **Furina:** The best Hydro option, due to her personal damage
    and DMG% buff. \n- **Yelan:** She provides off-field damage and a ramping DMG%
    buff for your on-field character. In teams without a dedicated on-fielder, make
    use of this buff by on-fielding your most damaging character during downtime.
    Sigewinne can not trigger Yelan’s Exquisite Throws during her Burst, so use Sigewinne’s
    Burst during Yelan’s downtime.\n- **Xingqiu:** The male version of Yelan. \n-
    **Kamisato Ayato:** A Hydro on-fielder. Use Sigewinne’s Burst during his downtime.
    His cooldowns  synergize well with Fischl.\n\n<:electro:1094545575992623115> **Electro
    options:**\n- **Fischl:** Her off-field damage and energy make her invaluable
    to this team. With her, the team prefers a 24 second rotation. As her A4, Skill,
    and C6 are all Skill damage, she will quickly eat up Sigewinne’s A1 procs. Her
    Skill will snapshot any buffs, or the lack of them.\n- **Yae Miko:** She provides
    off-field damage, and can on-field in downtime with her Normal and Charged Attacks.
    She requires another Electro teammate to consistently use her Burst.\n- **Beidou:**
    Only viable in Double Electro teams due to her high ER requirements. Makes for
    a very comfortable team due to her shield and DMG Reduction. Use Sigewinne’s Burst
    in her downtime.\n- **Raiden Shogun:** Raiden is a comfortable on-fielder due
    to her inability to be interrupted. She lowers ER requirements across the entire
    team.\n\n<:anemo:1094545726748508250> **Anemo options:**\nAnemo characters are
    all able to hold 4pc VV to greatly increase team damage.\n- **Kazuha:** His DMG%,
    grouping, and personal damage  make him the best Anemo option by far. Try to use
    his Skills as often as possible as they deal significant reaction damage.\n- **Sucrose:**
    Despite the reactions triggered by this team, her EM buff is mostly irrelevant
    as the majority of damage is talent damage. She provides grouping and  can hold
    Hakushin Ring or TTDS. As a driver, she uses her Normal Attacks, Charged Attacks,
    and Skills while on-field.\n- **Heizou:** Provides much of the same utility as
    Sucrose, both buff-wise and as a driver.\n- **Lynette:** Her 12s Skill CD lines
    up well with Fischl. At C6 she can drive the team. She provides an ATK% buff,
    taunt, minor grouping, personal damage,  and 4pc VV.\n- **Venti:** His Burst groups
    enemies and triggers many reactions for high personal damage. His Burst has an
    absorption priority of Hydro over Electro. In Solo Hydro teams, this can be controlled
    by delaying Sigewinne Skill."
