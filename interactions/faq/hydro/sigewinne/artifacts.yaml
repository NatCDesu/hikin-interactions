    <:sands:1094559345364185119> *Sands of Eon:* HP% / ER%
    <:goblet:1094559512968581130> *Goblet of Eonothem:* HP% / Hydro DMG%
    <:circlet:1094559608581922966> *Circlet of Logos:* HP% / CRIT

    As long as there are CRIT substats, HP%/HP%/HP% or ER%/HP%/HP% are the most optimal main stats for Sigewinne. These main stats are better than a Hydro DMG% Goblet or a CRIT Circlet by 2–5%, even when using Burst every rotation but can be used as alternatives.

    **Substats:** ER until requirement > HP% > CRIT > HP

    __Artifact Sets__

    **4pc Song of Days Past**
  description: One of Sigewinne’s best sets in terms of team damage, providing additional
    Flat DMG to other characters. Teammates with large amounts of DMG Bonus will generally
    make use of this set the most.

- title: "**4pc Ocean-Hued Clam**"
  description: Very close to 4pc SoDP in terms of damage and beats it out in AoE scenarios,
    turning Sigewinne’s healing into periodic Physical DMG instances. For supportive
    playstyles, choose between 4pc OHC and SoDP.

- title: "**4pc Emblem of Severed Fate**"
  description: 4pc EoSF tends to perform worse than 4pc SoDP and 4pc OHC by ~20%,
    making it not worth farming specifically for Sigewinne, but if players want to
    make use of her Elemental Burst, it could be used as a temporary alternative if
    there are extra sets lying around from farming for other characters.

- title: "**2pc HB%/HP%/ER%/Hydro DMG% combos**"
  description: 2pc combos can be used as a cheap alternative, or whilst farming for
    a 4pc set.
