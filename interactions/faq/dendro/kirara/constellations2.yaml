    Three extra levels to Kirara’s Skill means that she has stronger shields and slightly more damage from her Skill. A solid Constellation for Kirara.

    **Constellation 4 - Steed of Skanda**
  description: |-
    > *After active character(s) protected by Shields of Safe Transport or Critical Transport Shields hit opponents with Normal, Charged, or Plunging Attacks, Kirara will perform a coordinated attack with them using Small Cat Grass Cardamoms, dealing 200% of her ATK as Dendro DMG. 
    > 
    > DMG dealt this way is considered Elemental Burst DMG. This effect can be triggered once every 3.8s. This CD is shared between all party members.*

    This Constellation is an interesting one. If your active character is protected by any of Kirara’s shields, their Normal / Charged / Plunging Attacks will trigger a coordinated attack, dealing Dendro DMG that scales off of Kirara’s Attack. This effect can be triggered a maximum of once every 3.8 seconds, and its CD is shared between all party members, meaning that it can only be triggered every 3.8 seconds as well in co-op.

    Sadly, due to Kirara preferring to be built as a shieldbot, the damage from this is very meagre, and will not contribute a lot. That being said, this gives her off-field Dendro application similar to Collei’s, and theoretically opens up the possibility of running her off-field in Hyperbloom teams.
