    **Constellation 5 - A Thousand Miles in a Day**
  description: |-
    > *Increases the Level of Secret Art: Surprise Dispatch by 3.*

    Increases Kirara’s Burst Talent level by 3, giving her more damage on her Burst and the subsequent bomblets. Again, not a particularly good Constellation by merit of Kirara preferring to build HP instead of damage.

    **Constellation 6 - Countless Sights to See**
  description: |- 
    > *All nearby party members will gain 12% All Elemental DMG Bonus within 15s after Kirara uses her Elemental Skill or Burst.*
    
    Provides a nice bit of Elemental DMG Bonus for 15 seconds after Kirara uses her Skill and/or Burst, enabling the party to do more damage all-around. 
    
    A solid Constellation, with its main downside being locked behind Constellation 6.
