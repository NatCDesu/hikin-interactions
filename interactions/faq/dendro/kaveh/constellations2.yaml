    **C3 - Profferings of Dur Untash**
  description: |-
    *Increases the Level of **Painted Dome** by 3.*

    Kaveh’s Burst holds great priority given its boost to Bloom damage, but having higher Talent levels increases that boost marginally. You only get about an extra 2% per Talent level, so you get an extra 8% Bloom DMG Bonus in total going from Talent Level 9 to 12. The bonus is quite small in the grand scheme of things, but it won’t hurt you. It is not recommended to aim for this constellation in particular

    **C4 - Feast of Apadana**

    *Dendro Cores created from Bloom reactions Kaveh triggers will deal 60% more DMG when they burst.*

    This constellation gives a straight bonus to Kaveh’s Bloom DMG, which is helpful if you intend on running him as a main DPS or driver. Unfortunately, he might still struggle to keep up with other Bloom DPS, since his own multipliers are quite low. Kaveh’s bonus will not apply to Burgeon or Hyperblooms, so his choice of teammates is limited if you want to take advantage of this. Kaveh will need a decent amount of ownership in order to do the best with this bonus.
