    **C5 - Treasures of Bonkhanak**

    *Increases the Level of **Artistic Ingenuity** by 3.*

    Unfortunately, the damage of the Skill itself is quite low, since most of Kaveh’s damage comes from his Normal Attacks and/or Blooms. This means that you won’t be getting much in terms of extra damage.

    **C6 -  Pairidaeza's Dreams**
  description: >- 
    *When Kaveh's Normal, Charged, or Plunging Attacks hit opponents during *Painted Dome*, it will unleash Pairidaeza's Light upon the opponent's position, dealing 61.8% of Kaveh's ATK as AoE Dendro DMG and causing all Dendro Cores within that AoE to burst. This effect can be triggered once every 3s.*

    C6 gives Kaveh 3-4 more detonations and Dendro application, making it a fairly valuable constellation on Bloom teams. Because Kaveh forces multiple Blooms to rupture at once, you may get less value than you’re hoping for from his Skill usage if you have more than two Cores from a single owner. His Elemental Skill is on a 6 second cooldown, meaning that Pairidaeza’s Light can sneak in some extra forced Core explosions while waiting. In Bloom comps, this extra frontloaded damage is appreciated, but not so useful in Nilou teams where Blooms instantly explode. Furthermore, C6 procs can prematurely rupture your Hyperblooms and Burgeons, possibly resulting in lower team DPS (although the extra Bloom damage might mitigate this DPS loss). Regardless, you get more AoE Dendro application with this constellation, which is useful on most teams. 

    The Pairidaeza’s Light damage itself is nothing to write home about in a standard EM-centric build. Even if you reached 2000 ATK, you’d only get about 1200 damage from it, which is pitiful next to even one extra Bloom.
