  - title: __**Non Plunge-Oriented Teammates**__
    description: >-
      Despite not being designed around Plunging Attacks, some current
      characters can make use of Plunging Attacks for higher damage combos,
      granting their team AoE or for the buffs provided by Xianyun’s A4.
      Generally, these mainly consist of characters with access to Vaporize or
      Melt, due to the large damage boost provided to her A4. However, there are
      characters outside of Amplifying reactions that can also make use of
      Xianyun for the same benefits listed previously.

  - title: '**Hu Tao**'
    description: >-
      Alongside Xianyun, Hu Tao gains access to a new combo, weaving in Plunging
      Attacks with her typical N2C combo. This new combo gives Hu Tao teams some
      AoE coverage, something her teams have lacked for a while. With Xianyun,
      Hu Tao is able to do up to 5(N2CJP) + N2C, although 5N2CJP may be
      preferred by most players due to being easier to execute, allowing for
      some leniency in how early you Plunge. Due to using less Charged Attacks
      than before, this cuts Hu Tao’s stamina usage in half, meaning C0 is
      punished less from dodging enemy attacks. Finally, Xianyun’s Healing over
      Time allows Hu Tao to stick with Furina as one of her two Hydro options,
      granting large amounts of DMG Bonus to the party. However, due to the long
      duration of Xianyun’s healing, teammates tend to have more HP than when
      played with Jean, leading to lower Fanfare averages throughout a rotation.

      Xianyun is also playable in VV Vape setups, being able to shred the
      resistances of both Pyro and Hydro with 4pc Viridescent Venerer. However,
      compared to other Anemos such as Sucrose or Kazuha, she does not provide
      any extra Elemental application through an absorption, meaning players may
      struggle to consistently Vaporize off only Yelan, instead preferring to
      use Xingqiu. Although Bennett is preferred in this team for his large ATK
      buff and extra Pyro DMG Bonus from his C6, other Pyro alternatives include
      C6 Chevreuse for large DMG Bonus buffs and C4 Yanfei or Thoma for their
      defensive utility.

  - title: '**Diluc**'
    description: >-
      Even though his kit wasn’t designed around it, Diluc already utilized
      Plunging Attacks through the use of Dragonstriking, a technique involving
      using the hitlag from hitting an enemy to increase a character’s jump
      height. This was due to Diluc having an above average Plunging Attack
      Multiplier compared to the rest of his Multipliers, resulting in tight
      execution combos for a majority of players that utilized Plunging Attacks.
      With Xianyun’s release, this is no longer an issue, due to her granting an
      increased jump height to perform Plunging Attacks with ease. Additionally,
      Diluc gains a significant buff from Xianyun’s A4 Passive, which is further
      enhanced by triggering Amplifying reactions on his Plunging Attacks.
      Players can opt for slower Plunges, weaving in N1s to keep Diluc targeting
      the nearest enemy, whilst triggering off-fielders such as Xingqiu or
      Yelan. Alternatively, Sword, Claymore, and Catalyst characters are able to
      immediately dash and jump upon landing with a Plunging Attack, resulting
      in faster Plunging Attacks at the cost of Stamina. Additionally, Plunging
      Attacks do not auto target onto enemies, resulting in the possibility of
      missing Diluc’s Plunging Attacks if players are carelessly Dash Plunging.
      Diluc also greatly benefits from Bennett’s C6 in this team, granting a
      Pyro Infusion and large ATK buff. Bennett’s Pyro Infusion also allows
      Diluc to ignore his own Elemental Burst, meaning he has no need for Energy
      Recharge stats and can focus fully on damage.

  - title: '**Bennett**'
    description: >-
      Whilst many characters utilizing Plunging Attacks use Bennett for his
      large ATK buff and Pyro Infusion, Bennett can make use of these himself,
      freeing up a team slot for another buffer or off-fielder. Bennett also has
      an unusually fast Plunging Attack animation, allowing him to perform more
      Plunging Attacks compared to other characters. When utilizing his
      Infusion, he will usually be played with Hydro characters, including
      Xingqiu, Yelan and Furina, in order to keep a consistent Hydro Aura to
      trigger Reverse Vaporize. 

      Because of his fast Plunges and large buffs, he can make use of other
      Elemental Infusions, in order to trigger other Amplifying reactions, such
      as Candace for Forward Vaporize and Chongyun for Reverse Melt. In these
      teams, Bennett will use the corresponding Elemental Goblet to match his
      Infusion, whilst generally being paired with Xiangling for both high
      off-field damage and Pyro Application. Please note that Chongyun’s Cryo
      Infusion will be overwritten by Bennett’s C6 Pyro Infusion due to Melting
      the Infusion. However, Candace does not have this issue, due to Vaporizing
      away Bennett’s Pyro Infusion.
