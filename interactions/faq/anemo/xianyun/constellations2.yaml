      Increases the Talent Level of Xianyun's Elemental Burst by 3, buffing both
      her healing and Starwicker DMG. Overall, this Constellation does not
      greatly increase her personal damage - and Xianyun is already a proficient
      healer at C0.

      > *After using Skyladder 1/2/3 times during one White Clouds at Dawn Cloud
      Transmogrification state, when a Driftcloud Wave unleashed during that
      instance hits an opponent, it will heal all nearby party members for
      50%/80%/150% of Xianyun's ATK. This effect can be triggered once every
      5s.*


      Xianyun's 4th Constellation offers a significant boost to her healing
      capabilities, allowing her to heal all party members with her Elemental
      Skill’s enhanced Plunging Attack. But again, Xianyun's healing output is
      already quite high and C4 will make the majority of her healing count as
      overheals.
