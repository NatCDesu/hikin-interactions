      Increases the Talent Level of Xianyun’s Elemental Skill by 3. This
      Constellation is quite underwhelming due to only increasing the damage her
      Skill deals, which is already very minor. It should only be seen as a
      stepping stone towards getting her C6, at which this Constellation becomes
      relevant.

      > *After Xianyun uses 1/2/3 Skyladders within one Cloud Transmogrification
      caused by White Clouds at Dawn, the CRIT DMG of a Driftcloud Wave created
      in this instance of Cloud Transmogrification will be increased by
      15%/35%/70%.

      Dawn will not enter CD. This effect will be canceled once she has used
      White Clouds at Dawn 8 times.*


      Xianyun’s C6 transforms her from a support into a DPS by removing her
      Elemental Skill CD after casting her Elemental Burst, whilst greatly
      increasing the CRIT DMG of her enhanced Plunging Attack. Since she can
      only produce Elemental Particles outside of her Burst’s duration - she
      needs to utilize the first instance of her Skill before her Burst, and
      second one after her its duration. It is advisable to run her with an
      Anemo character like Faruzan - who can also provide buffs to her Anemo
      DMG. Please note, this effect will end once Xianyun has used her Elemental
      Skill 8 times, meaning it can not be used infinitely for long distance
      travel in the overworld.
