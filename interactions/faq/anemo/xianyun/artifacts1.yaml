      <:sands:1094559345364185119> *Sands of Eon:* ER% / ATK%

      <:goblet:1094559512968581130> *Goblet of Eonothem:* ATK%

      <:circlet:1094559608581922966> *Circlet of Logos:* ATK% / HB%


      As Xianyun’s Starwicker, Healing and A4 Passive scale with her Attack
      stat, the primary goal of Xianyun’s artifact stats will be to maximize her
      Attack stat while meeting the relevant ER Requirements to reliably Burst
      every rotation. If players find it challenging to survive on Xianyun’s
      healing alone though, a Healing Bonus Circlet can be used to supplement
      her healing.


      **Substats:** ER until requirement > ATK% > CR (if using Fav) >= Flat ATK


      As previously mentioned, players will want to focus on Bursting with
      Xianyun every rotation before throwing as many substats as possible into
      ATK%. CRIT Rate is a decent substat if Xianyun is holding Favonius Codex,
      as it increases her chances of proccing the weapon’s passive.

      __Recommended Sets__

      **4PC Viridescent Venerer**
    description: >-
      The bread and butter of any Anemo support featuring in PECH
      reaction-centric teams, Viridescent Venerer synergizes perfectly with
      Xianyun, enabling her to reduce enemy Resistances by 40%, increasing her
      teammates’ damage. This should be her go-to set in most cases unless being
      run with characters who don’t need the RES Shred, such as Xiao.

  - title: '**4PC Noblesse Oblige**'
    description: >-
      Should your primary DPS(s) not make good use of 4pc VV, 4pc Noblesse
      Oblige is another fantastic option for ATK-scaling DPS(s). One
      particularly notable scenario where this may work would be in Xiao teams,
      since Xiao appreciates the ATK buff from Noblesse quite a fair bit. 4pc
      Noblesse also increases the Flat DMG Buff provided by Xianyun’s A4,
      further increasing your on-fielders damage output.

  - title: '**4PC Ocean-Hued Clam**'
    description: >-
      In teams where 4pc VV and / or NO is already being held by someone else or
      are just not needed entirely, Xianyun can also opt to hold 4pc OHC for
      more personal damage. With a rather sizable initial heal and several
      smaller but consistent sustained heals, Xianyun easily heals about 2/3s of
      the Sea-Dyed Foam with every tick, making her a very potent carrier of the
      set.

  - title: '**2PC ER / ATK / HB**'
    description: >-
      In teams that do not require Xianyun to hold either 4pc VV or NO, she can
      run mixed sets for a much easier time in building her. With how popular a
      set Emblem is to farm, along with the plethora of ATK% sets out there,
      running mixed sets on her makes gearing her a piece of cake, allowing you
      to turn your attention to farming for your other characters.
