      <:sands:1094559345364185119> *Sands of Eon:* ER% / ATK%

      <:goblet:1094559512968581130> *Goblet of Eonothem:* ATK%

      As Xianyun’s Starwicker, Healing and A4 Passive scale with her Attack
      stat, the primary goal of Xianyun’s artifact stats will be to maximize her
      Attack stat while meeting the relevant ER Requirements to reliably Burst
      every rotation. If players find it challenging to survive on Xianyun’s
      healing alone though, a Healing Bonus Circlet can be used to supplement
      her healing.


      **Substats:** ER until requirement > ATK% > CR (if using Fav) >= Flat ATK


      As previously mentioned, players will want to focus on Bursting with
      Xianyun every rotation before throwing as many substats as possible into
      ATK%. CRIT Rate is a decent substat if Xianyun is holding Favonius Codex,
      as it increases her chances of proccing the weapon’s passive.
