          *Pre-TC is volatile and, as always, perpetually subject to change
          until release (and sometimes later!). Please note that these are
          theoretical suggestions.

          Everything described in this FAQ is a good faith analysis based on the
          little information about the character’s kit that we know. Team calcs,
          additionally, are not established yet, and as with everything in TC,
          the content in this FAQ should be taken with a grain of salt.*

  - title: __OVERVIEW__
    description: >-
      Xianyun is a 5-star Anemo Catalyst character who provides strong teamwide
      healing and buffs to Plunging Attacks. Her Elemental Skill causes her to
      enter the Cloud Transmogrification state and leap into the air. If Xianyun
      uses a Plunging Attack during this state, she will make a fast descent to
      the ground, homing in on a nearby opponent to deal AoE Anemo DMG. This
      Skill can be used up to 3 times before performing a Plunging Attack,
      increasing Xianyun’s height and the damage dealt by her Plunging Attack.
      Depending on the amount of enemies hit,  Xianyun will slightly increase
      the CRIT Rate of Plunging Attacks for all nearby party members. 


      Her Elemental Burst heals all party members over time whilst increasing
      their jump height and providing Adeptal Assistance stacks. When the active
      character performs a Plunging Attack, Xianyun will deal a coordinated
      attack and consume an Adeptal Assistance stack. Whilst having Adeptal
      Assistance stacks, Xianyun will provide a Flat DMG Bonus to Plunging
      Attacks based on her ATK.


      Xianyun will primarily be played as an off-field supportive teammate,
      providing large AoE healing to the party and greatly buffing the damage
      dealt by Plunging Attacks, whilst enabling all characters to perform
      Plunging Attacks due to the increased jump height.
