      Wanderer’s combos are fairly difficult to precisely pin down. His kit is
      designed with Normal Attacks in mind, so any weapon that benefits Normal
      Attacks excels. However, with many weapons that don’t fit this criteria,
      N2C helps squeeze around. 


      We calculated based on the following assumptions, but the number of
      attacks are conservative estimates. You may get more than what we’ve
      assumed.


      **Tullaytullah’s Remembrance + 4pc Desert Pavilion : **
      

      (Q), E, CA, N3x6


      **(N2C Version) Most weapons on Desert Pavilion : ** 


      (Q), E, C, N2C (x5) + N2


      **(N2C Version) Most weapons with NO ATK SPD buffs :** 
      
      
      (Q), E, N2C (x5) + N1


      **(N3 Version) Most weapons on Desert Pavilion :**
      

      (Q), E, CA, N3x5 + N2


      **(N3 Version) Most weapons with NO ATK SPD buffs : ** 
      

      (Q), E, CA, N3x5 + N1


      **Dodoco Tales CA Spam on Desert Pavilion :** 
      

      (Q), E, N1, CAx6, N1, CAx6 


      Based on these calculations, N2C can squeeze out more damage. However,
      this is mostly for players using low ATK SPD, non-Yunjin teams. Newer info
      that is being released leans towards this being more of a sidegrade, so
      calcs may not perfectly reflect this. That said, N2C is *not* always a
      strict upgrade.


      N2D, when controlled, might deal even more, provided you ***only*** dash
      when A4 activates - learning to master the dash timing will take time,
      rewarding the player for going the extra mile, but not dealing *so* much
      more damage that it’s mandatory to get down (about 10%). Dashing too
      early, however, will tank the damage in your rotation.


      Even further, Wanderer’s A4 has a visual indicator for when you can dash
      without stamina consumption to unleash bonus attacks. You can increase
      your damage even further by dash-cancelling N2 or N3 once you know for
      sure you can trigger the A4 passive.


      **Again, we urge you to take this with a grain of salt - research on these
      combos is ongoing.**
