      ## __Analysis__

      - The essential parts of Xianyun’s kit are her Burst and Passive Talents.
      Her kit revolves around enabling and greatly buffing Plunging Attacks
      while healing. Her buffs are tied only to Passive Talents, however her
      healing is tied to her Elemental Burst, making it a recommended Talent to
      prioritize.
