      **4PC Maiden’s Beloved**
    description: A nice boost to Xianyun’s healing, but offers nothing else beside that.

      A direct downgrade to Ocean-Hued Clam, since its buff is weaker than the
      potential damage that OHC can output. Only use it if you have a decent set
      from farming for Navia.

      This set helps Xianyun reach her ER Requirements whilst buffing her Burst
      damage ever so slightly. That being said, Xianyun’s Burst doesn’t have a
      lot of damage contribution compared to the rest of her team, so this set
      is slightly lackluster.
