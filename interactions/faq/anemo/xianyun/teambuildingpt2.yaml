  - title: __Plunge-Oriented Teammates__
    description: >-
      Although limited in number, characters already designed around Plunging
      Attacks can make use of Xianyun’s A1 and A4 Passives to boost their damage
      output. Since Xianyun’s A4 Passive is considered Additive Flat DMG, DMG
      Bonus and CRIT stats will be preferred, due to affecting both the
      character’s Base DMG and Xianyun’s Flat DMG Bonus. In Vaporize and Melt
      focused teams, Xianyun’s buff also benefits heavily from EM stats, due to
      being affected by Amplifying reactions.

      Xiao makes excellent use of Xianyun’s A4 due to the large amounts of DMG
      Bonus he gains after casting his Elemental Burst, granting him some extra
      help when dealing with single-target scenarios. The increased want for DMG
      Bonus stats alongside Xianyun’s high teamwide Healing over Time also
      allows Xiao to be played with Furina without being confined to the area of
      Bennett’s Elemental Burst, an issue Xiao has struggled with for a long
      time due to gaining too much DMG Bonus compared to other stats at the
      time. Not being confined to Bennett’s Burst frees up his movement,
      allowing him to chase after enemies being knocked away by his Plunging
      Attack’s high Poise damage. Although Bennett can still be used if players
      wish, Faruzan is a given for her potent Anemo-related buffs, providing DMG
      Bonus, Anemo RES Shred, as well as Anemo CRIT DMG and off-field Anemo
      Particles at C6. Despite Faruzans A4 Passive being a rather small Flat DMG
      buff, it still contributes to preferring DMG Bonus and CRIT compared to
      ATK stats. Finally, Xianyun’s 5 Anemo Particles can greatly help lower
      both Xiao and Faruzan’s egregious ER Requirements, helping non-C6 Faruzan
      to reliably Burst every rotation. 

      Depending on the content, Xiao can play both a shorter or a longer
      rotation, varying the amount of Plunging Attacks he uses without
      sacrificing on overall team damage. A longer rotation will help to lower
      the team’s overall ER Requirements, whereas a shorter rotation may be
      helpful for sustaining buff uptime across multiple waves of enemies or for
      granting Xiao more Plunging Attacks with Xianyuns A4 Passive to help with
      tankier single-target fights.

      Gaming is a new 4-star Pyro Claymore character focused on Plunging
      Attacks, who will be obtainable for free from the Friends at the Doorstep
      event as part of the upcoming Lantern Rite Festival. Although Gaming
      doesn’t have access to the large amounts of DMG Bonus Xiao gets, he is
      able to trigger Vaporize and Melt on his Plunging Attacks, allowing him to
      greatly amplify his damage with EM stats when under the effects of
      Xianyun’s A4 Passive. Vaporize teams tend to make use of C6 Bennett’s Pyro
      Infusion, allowing Gaming to Vaporize more buffed Plunging Attacks,
      whereas Melt teams prefer to guarantee he triggers Melt on his Skill
      Plunging Attacks. For more details on Gaming’s teams, please check out the
      [Gaming FAQ](https://wangshengfp.org/faq/gaming/).
