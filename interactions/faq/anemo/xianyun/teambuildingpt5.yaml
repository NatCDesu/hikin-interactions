    description: >-
      Despite also not being intended for Plunging Attacks, at C3, Freminet
      gains +3 levels to his Normal Attack Talent, increasing the damage dealt
      by his Plunging Attacks. Despite having significantly lower Base ATK than
      Diluc, the MVs are quite similar, making Freminet a viable option for
      Xianyun teams. Additionally, Freminet has several options for team
      archetypes, including Pyro, Cryo and Physical. For each archetype, the
      corresponding Elemental Goblet will be used based on Freminet’s Infusion.

  - title: Pyro Freminet
    description: >-
      On a team with C6 Bennett, Pyro Freminet can utilize the Pyro Infusion in
      order to Vaporize his Plunging Attacks while ignoring his Skill and Burst.
      Bennett also provides a strong Flat ATK buff from his Burst, helping to
      make up for Freminet's low Base ATK. The last teammate should be a Hydro
      off-fielder who can apply enough Hydro for Freminet to consistently
      trigger Vaporize.

  - title: Cryo Freminet
    description: >-
      Alongside his Level 0 Skill, Cryo Freminet utilizes Chongyun's Skill to
      infuse his Plunging Attacks with Cryo. There are a few choices for the
      fourth team slot: Bennett provides a large ATK buff, but cannot be used at
      C6; Furina brings solid off-field damage and a large DMG% buff; and
      Xiangling allows Freminet to Melt his Plunging Attacks, but has extremely
      high ER Requirements. For the duration of his Elemental Burst, Freminet
      will repeatedly use his Skill for Level 0 Shattering Pressure hits,
      followed up by a Plunging Attack during the short downtime between Skill
      activations.

  - title: Physical Freminet
    description: >-
      With an Electro teammate like Fischl or Yae Miko, Physical Freminet can be
      played, using his Skill before performing Plunging Attacks in order to
      trigger Superconduct. The fourth team slot can be various units with
      off-field utility, including defensive options such as Zhongli or Layla,
      who provide comfort at the cost of damage; damage dealers such as Furina,
      Xingqiu, or Rosaria; or buffers such as pre-C6 Bennett or Mika, whose C6
      is pivotal to him being useful in the team. Depending on your 4th
      teammate, Xianyun can optionally change her Artifact set from 4pc
      Viridescent Venerer to any of 4pc Noblesse Oblige, 4pc Ocean-Hued Clam or
      4pc Song of Days Past. However, 4pc VV will generally be preferred if
      being paired with another off-field damage dealer.
