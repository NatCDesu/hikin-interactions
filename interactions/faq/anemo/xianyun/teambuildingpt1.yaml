  - title: __TEAM BUILDING__
    description: >-
      Xianyun’s ability to allow any team to utilize Plunging Attacks opens up a
      large number of possibilities for current and future teambuilding.
      Although not all characters will make use of Xianyun to her full effect,
      she can be slotted into almost any team, providing AoE damage through
      Plunging Attacks, alongside strong Healing over Time to all teammates,
      helping to keep characters healthy. 

      Due to her universality, some standout teammates will be listed rather
      than set archetypes, whilst also providing a few sample teams instead of
      an exhaustive list. For more info on a specific character, please check
      out their respective FAQs or KQM Guides. **Please keep in mind that the ER
      Requirements shown are for Xianyun with no additional support from weapons
      providing Energy, such as Favonius or Crane’s Echoing Call.**

  - title: '**Plunging Weapon Type Differences**'
    description: >-
      Not all Plunging Attacks are made equal, although they’re generally
      similar overall, there are some minor differences between each weapon
      type:

      - **Sword** - Standard Plunging Attack with the Collision hitbox
      positioned at the center of the attack. Can be dash-canceled immediately
      and flows into N1.
       - **Alternative Sword** - Considerably faster startup lag than the traditional Sword Plunging Attack. Only applicable to Albedo and Bennett.
      - **Polearm** - Very similar to Sword Plunging Attacks. They cannot be
      dash-canceled but have a slightly faster N1 cancellation.

      - **Catalyst** - Very similar to Sword Plunging Attacks. They will always
      deal Elemental DMG based on the character’s Element.

      - **Claymore** - Slightly faster startup lag with the Collision hitbox
      positioned in front of the character.

      - **Bow** - Slightly slower startup lag. Can be buffered into Aiming Mode
      with R and are unaffected by Elemental Infusion effects from other
      characters.

  - title: '**Elemental Weapon Infusers**'
    description: >-
      Currently, our Elemental Infusers consist of Bennett C6, Candace and
      Chongyun, each providing a Pyro, Hydro and Cryo Infusion respectively to
      Sword, Claymore and Polearm characters. Characters can make use of these
      Infusions alongside Xianyun in order to make use of both Elemental Goblets
      on their Plunging Attacks, as well as Amplifying reactions to heavily
      increase the damage dealt from Xianyun’s A4 Passive. However, unless using
      one of these three as your dedicated Plunging on-fielder, it may be hard
      to have enough team slots available. For consistent Vaporize or Melt,
      Xiangling is mandatory, but may struggle from harsh ER Requirements when
      using Candace or Chongyun, due to not having space to fit Bennett in the
      team alongside your preferred on-fielder. Bennett not only doubles as an
      Elemental Infuser but also provides a large ATK buff, allowing him to fit
      nicely into teams whilst still having space for a Hydro character, such as
      Furina or Xingqiu to trigger consistent Vaporize reactions on your
      on-fielder’s Plunging Attacks.
