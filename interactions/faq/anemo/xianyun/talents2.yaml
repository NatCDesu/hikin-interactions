      __TALENT OVERVIEW__

      **Normal Attack: Word of Wind and Flower**
    description: >-
      Xianyun performs a 4-hit Anemo attack string. This Talent is not essential
      to her kit, although with her being an Anemo Catalyst character, her
      Normal Attacks allow her to be a driver for various teams.

      Xianyun’s Skill causes her to enter the Cloud Transmogrification state.
      During this state, her Skill can be pressed three times, with each press
      making her leap higher into the air. She gains an enhanced Plunging Attack
      during this state called Driftcloud Wave, where she transforms into a
      crane, dealing more damage in a wider area depending on how many times her
      Skill is pressed. If her enhanced Plunging Attack isn’t cast during the
      Cloud Transmogrification state, the cooldown for the next Skill cast will
      be reduced by 3s. Her Skill can be used three times quickly to ascend
      higher, or after touching the ground to gain horizontal distance, helping
      with exploration.


      Xianyun generates five Anemo Particles regardless of how many times her
      Skill is pressed, which means there is no actual need to do three presses
      for more Particles unless a higher damage output of her Skill is desired.
      The particles will only spawn when her enhanced Plunging Attack lands.

      The main attraction of Xianyun’s kit. Xianyun heals the team and summons a
      Starwicker upon the initial cast of her Burst. Starwicker mainly does
      three things: heal, increase active characters’ jumping height, and deal
      damage. Its healing is Xianyun’s only source of healing pre-C4 but is
      completely teamwide and heals once every 2.5 seconds. The Healing provided
      by Xianyun’s Elemental Burst is strong enough to sustain a majority of
      teams for players, without the need for additional defensive characters,
      such as another healer or shielder. 


      A Starwicker has 8 stacks of Adeptal Assistance upon summoning. Adeptal
      Assistance allows the character to have an increased jumping height. Upon
      hitting an enemy with a Plunging Attack, Starwicker will unleash a
      coordinated attack, dealing Anemo DMG and consuming one stack of Adeptal
      Assistance. Adeptal Assistance stacks cannot be regained, hence only a
      maximum of 8 Starwicker hits can be triggered throughout Xianyun’s Burst
      duration.


      Xianyun’s Burst allows basically everyone to spam Plunging Attacks, which
      opens up possibilities for new teams and combos. These will be discussed
      in the Teambuilding section of this FAQ.
