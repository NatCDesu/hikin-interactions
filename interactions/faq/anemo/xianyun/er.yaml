    description: >-
      Xianyun wants to cast her Burst every rotation, and with a 70 Energy cost,
      it makes her ER Requirements quite high. She generates 5 Anemo Particles
      regardless of how many times her Skill is pressed. At C1, she gains 1
      additional charge on her Skill. However, in a typical 20s rotation, those
      additional charges can only be triggered once every other rotation due to
      her Skill’s 12s CD. Regarding these, C1 reduces her ER Requirements by
      around 15%–50% depending on the team. 


      Her C6 however doesn’t really aid, and in some cases, hinders her Energy
      problems despite her Skill not entering CD for 16s after casting Burst due
      to it not generating Particles during those 16s. Since Xianyun’s ER
      Requirements can be very high, they may vary drastically when played as a
      solo Anemo, depending on how many Particles her teammates generate
      overall. For specific ER Requirements in some teams, please refer to the
      Teambuilding section of this FAQ.


      Her signature weapon, Crane’s Echoing Call, gives her 2.5 Flat Energy per
      Plunging Attack at R1, reducing her ER Requirements by 5%–10% per Plunge
      depending on the team. One of her recommended F2P weapons, Oathsworn Eye,
      also aids in Xianyun’s ER Requirements, granting her 24% ER for 10s at R1.
      The ER increase doubles if players have managed to R5 the weapon during
      the Version 2.5 event where Oathsworn Eye was obtainable. 


      If these weapons aren’t available, Xianyun can also hold Favonius Codex to
      not only aid in her own Energy problems, but also the entire team’s. Refer
      to the table below to find out how much ER is saved per trigger of
      Favonius’ Passive.


      Xianyun’s ER Requirements will vary based on your team and rotation. For a
      more accurate estimate, please use the Energy Recharge Calculator linked
