  - title: '**Raiden**'
    description: >-
      Unfortunately, due to Raiden’s Burst stance being considered Burst DMG,
      she is unable to receive the Flat DMG buff provided by Xianyun’s A4.
      Despite this, she still has access to a new combo, being 4(N1CJP).
      Although this combo was previously possible via Dragonstriking, it was
      very hard to execute and only worked under specific scenarios. The
      execution can still be tight to get the 4th Plunging Attack in whilst
      getting both hits of her Charged Attack before jumping, however, Xianyun’s
      release makes this combo more accessible, whilst allowing the use of a
      wider variety of teammates. Characters such as Sara and Bennett can be
      used for a Hyper-style team, Nahida for an Aggravate team or teammates
      such as Xiangling for high off-field damage or Furina for both off-field
      damage and buffing. Raiden also helps to significantly lower Xianyun’s ER
      Requirements, granting ~20–25 Flat Energy to all teammates depending on
      her Energy Recharge.

  - title: '**Wriothesley**'
    description: >-
      All Catalyst characters deal entirely Elemental DMG, meaning they can be
      played with Xianyun to apply large amounts of their respective element in
      AoE. Catalyst users such as Wriothesley can make great use of this to
      trigger consistent Reverse Melts with Xiangling. Although Wriothesley’s
      Plunging Attacks aren’t buffed by his Skill, this means he also won’t
      drain his HP as fast whilst doing Plunging Attack combos. To allow for
      both Particle generation and the use of 4pc Marechaussee Hunter,
      Wriothesley starts his combo with N3C, before transitioning into N1JP to
      keep up stacks on 4pc MH. If players manage to trigger his A1 Passive
      during gameplay, they can instead use N1CJP for an extra Melt, due to
      Wriothesley being able to jump cancel his Charged Attack very quickly.
      Alternatively, players can choose to spend some extra stamina on Dash
      Plunging for faster Plunging Attacks. Additionally, Catalyst users can’t
      be affected by other Elemental Infusions, meaning it does not matter if
      Bennett is C6 to utilize them.
