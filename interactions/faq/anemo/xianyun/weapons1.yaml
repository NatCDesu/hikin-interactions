      Xianyun mostly needs ER and ATK stats, so any weapon that gives a good
      amount of either is beneficial.


      However, her ER requirement as a solo Anemo is usually very high , so you
      will likely not be able to use a weapon that doesn’t give ER or Flat
      Energy in those teams. **The only teams where weapons that don't give ER
      or Flat Energy are viable is when there are 2 or 3 Anemo characters in the
      team**, with the most obvious candidate being in a team with Xiao.

    description: >-
      Crane’s Echoing Call is Xianyun’s Best-In-Slot weapon in any team where
      the main carry uses Plunging Attacks. Everything is perfect for Xianyun’s
      kit. It has a high Base ATK and gives ATK%, both important stats for her
      A4. It also gives a decent amount of Flat Energy which is really welcomed
      to help her reach her ER requirement, especially when she is solo Anemo.
      Moreover, it buffs Plunging Attack DMG for teammates, which helps her for
      her role as a Plunging Attack buffer. It increases your main carry’s DPS
      by about 10–12% compared to a F2P weapon like Oathsworn Eye, which is a
      great boost, but the damage gained to the carry can be compared to low
      priority signature weapons like Raiden’s signature or Navia’s signature,
      and it’s only useful on Xianyun.

      These weapons are great because they give a lot of attack through a high
      Base ATK and some ATK%. They are the 2nd, 3rd and 4th best options
      respectively in teams with multiple Anemo characters. However, these
      weapons don’t give any ER or Flat Energy, so they are not viable if your
      Xianyun is the only Anemo in the team due to her high ER requirement
      (unless you manage to get 70%–80% ER through substats).

    description: >-
      Favonius Codex is a strong option, being the 2nd best option in teams
      where Xianyun is the only Anemo character (assuming you proc the passive
      once), but it falls behind other options in a team with Xiao. However,
      building CRIT Rate is necessary to use this weapon, which is not as easy
      as it seems since an ATK% Circlet is recommended. Xianyun only does 2 or 3
      hits (with the 3rd hit being unreliable), and it’s not easy to have more
      than 40% CRIT Rate with only substats. By building only 40% CRIT Rate, you
      will have 64% chance to CRIT with 2 hits and 78% chance to CRIT with 3
      hits, which make this weapon not extremely reliable. Don’t hesitate to use
      1 or 2 Normal Attacks to have more chances to proc the passive.

  - title: '**Oathsworn Eye**'
    description: >-
      Oathsworn is a great F2P weapon from an event in 2.5. The high Base ATK,
      ATK% secondary stat, and ER passive make it a strong and versatile option
      for Xianyun. The ER from the passive lasts for only 10 seconds, but it
      includes the moment where she receives 5 Particles from her Skill. This
      weapon is viable in any team, including when she is the only Anemo
      character or with multiple Anemo.

      This weapon is a great F2P option because it can grant a teammate 48% ATK
      at R5. However, it is only really relevant if you play with Xiao, because
      there isn’t any other team that needs ATK% buff, where Xianyun can afford
      a weapon without any ER or Flat Energy, and where the rotation allows her
      to give the buff to the carry. Moreover, you need to make sure to only
      switch to Xianyun right before switching to your carry, otherwise you
      won’t give the buff to the right teammate. Furthermore, the low Base ATK
      will reduce the Plunging Attack buff from Xianyun’s A4 Passive
      significantly, making this weapon only on par with Oathsworn Eye or
      Flowing Purity with Xiao. Finally, having less attack means that her
      healing will be lower, which not only reduces survivability but also
      reduces Fanfare gain from Furina. If you play Xiao with 4pc Vermillion,
      the bonus from this weapon will have less value due to the high amount of
      ATK%.
