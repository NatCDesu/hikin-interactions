      Good 5-star weapons with high Base ATK. However, the secondary stats and
      the passives only buff Xianyun’s own damage, which is not very relevant in
      the first place. Even then, these weapons are good enough to make them on
      par with Oathsworn Eye and TTDS. However, these weapons don’t give any ER
      or Flat Energy, so they are not viable if your Xianyun is the only Anemo
      in the team due to her high ER requirement (unless you manage to get
      70%–80% ER through substats).

      Great F2P weapons with ATK% secondary stat. Amongst them, Flowing Purity
      is slightly better thanks to its high Base ATK and not completely useless
      passive. However, these weapons don’t give any ER or Flat Energy, so they
      are not viable if your Xianyun is the only Anemo in the team due to her
      high ER requirement (unless you manage to get 70%–80% ER through
      substats).

      Great F2P weapon from 4.1 which gives high Base ATK and ER secondary stat.
      It’s a weapon that can be used in any team but it’s not the greatest.

  - title: '**Prototype Amber**'
    description: >-
      An interesting F2P weapon that gives some teamwide healing and Flat
      Energy, making it viable in teams where Xianyun is the only Anemo
      character. The extra healing can help to receive more Fanfare from Furina.
      However, it only gives about an extra 1% average DMG%, which is not enough
      to surpass other F2P options and compensate for the lack of high Base ATK
      or ATK%. This is due to the fact that Xianyun’s teamwide healing is large
      enough that your team’s HP will not go lower than 90–95%, and also because
      Prototype Amber healing ticks happen almost at the same time as the
      healing ticks from Xianyun’s Burst.
