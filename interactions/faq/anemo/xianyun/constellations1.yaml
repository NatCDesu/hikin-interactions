      **Constellation 1 - Purifying Wind**
    description: >-
      > *White Clouds at Dawn gains 1 additional charge.*


      Xianyun gains an additional charge on her Elemental Skill, which allows
      her to perform two single leaps to gain Anemo Particles. However, this can
      only be performed every other rotation because of the Elemental Skill's
      CD. If paired with her signature weapon, it makes a dent in her ER
      Requirements since it allows Xianyun to perform two extra Plunging
      Attacks. Overall, this Constellation does not increase her personal damage
      or team DPS by any significant margin.

      > *After using a Skyladder from White Clouds at Dawn, Xianyun's ATK will
      be increased by 20% for 15s.

      > Additionally, the effects of the Passive Talent "Consider, the Adeptus
      in Her Realm" will be enhanced: When the Starwicker created by Stars
      Gather at Dusk has Adeptal Assistance stacks, nearby active characters'
      Plunging Attack shockwave DMG will be increased by 400% of Xianyun's ATK.
      The maximum DMG increase that can be achieved this way is 18,000.

      > Each Plunging Attack shockwave DMG instance can only apply this
      increased DMG effect to a single opponent. Each character can trigger this
      effect once every 0.4s.

      > You must first unlock the Passive Talent "Consider, the Adeptus in Her
      Realm."*


      C2 doubles the effects of Xianyun’s A4 Passive, providing a massive
      increase to her Plunging Attack buffs. Just as before, this effect is
      considered Flat DMG Bonus, meaning it scales with the on-field character’s
      DMG% and CRIT stats. Additionally, it also scales with Elemental Mastery
      when triggering Melt or Vaporize on hits buffed by Xianyun’s A4. The MV
      provided by this effect is larger than most character’s Plunging Attack
      MVs, increasing an on-field carry’s personal damage by ~35%, whilst
      increasing the team’s overall damage by ~25%.
