      __**CONSTELLATIONS**__

      **C1 - Shoban: Ostentatious Plumage**
    description: >-
      Increases NA/CA ATK SPD by 10% and increases the total damage of A4 Procs
      from 140% ATK to 240% ATK.


      Allows Wanderer to fit 1-3 NAs more into a DPS Window. Increasing total
      DPS by 6-11%.

      Value can vary based on how much ATK SPD Wanderer already has.

      The increased A4 damage can further increase the value of this
      Constellation if Wanderer

      has to dodge frequently or can utilize A4 Dash Cancels for a DPS gain.


      *Individual Increase: 6-11%*

      *Total Increase from C0: 8.5%*

  - title: '**C2 - Niban: Moonlit Isle Amidst White Waves**'
    description: >-
      Grants Wanderer increased Q DMG% based on Kuugoryoku Points spent while in
      his Skill State, up to 200% after 50 points spent.


      Grants Wanderer a powerful nuke option but also forces him to use his
      Burst as a finisher at the end of his DPS window. Generally yields around
      15% more total DPS, which isn’t impressive for a C2. The effective value
      of this Cons however can be higher due to the practical advantages of
      powerful nuking abilities.

      Only major stopping point for Wanderer Constellations prior to C6.


      *Individual Increase: 14-17%*

      *Total Increase from C0: 25%*

  - title: '**C3 - Sanban: Moonflower Kusemai**'
    description: >-
      Increases the Wanderer’s Elemental Burst Talent Level by 3.


      Further build upon the nuking power of his Burst after C2, but nothing to
      write home about in terms of value. Usually around 5% more DPS.


      *Individual Increase: 5%*

      *Total Increase from C0: 32%*

  - title: '**C4: Yonban: Set Adrift Into Spring**'
    description: >-
      Grants Wanderer an additional Elemental Absorption Buff he doesn't already
      have at random, when he is absorbing an Element with his Skill and
      increases the cap of Buffs to 3.

      Can provide 0%-15% more damage. The randomness makes these Buffs difficult
      to use consistently, as they may require you to adjust your Stats, are
      devalued in some Teams or require changes in your rotation.

      Hence a pessimistic evaluation at 0%.


      Generally: Cryo > Pyro > Electro/Hydro  


      *Individual Increase: 0% (up to 15% at the mercy of RNG)*

  - title: '**C5 - Matsuban: Ancient Illuminator From Abroad**'
    description: >-
      Increases the Wanderer’s Elemental Skill Talent Level by 3.


      The value of Skill Talent Levels on Wanderer is generally pretty awful,
      making this his arguably weakest Constellation at around 3% more total
      damage.


      *Individual Increase: 3%*

      *Total Increase from C0: 36%*

  - title: '**C6 - Shugen: The Curtains’ Melancholic Sway**'
    description: >-
      Causes the Wanderer to shoot a second Kuugo:Fushoudan (Skill State Normal
      Attack) whenever he uses a Normal Attack in his Skill State.

      This second attack deals 40% of the original Normal Attack and also counts
      as a Normal Attack.

      Additionally when Wanderer drops below 40 Kuugoryoku Points, his Normal
      Attacks will restore 4 such Points with a 0.2s CD, up to 5 times in total
      per Skill use.


      The additional Normal Attacks are the primary value of this Constellation,
      effectively increasing his Normal Attack dmg by a total 40% or about 25%
      more total damage. A notable synergy is being able to rapidly fire the
      added Bonus Damage Stacks granted by Yun Jin’s Elemental Burst.

      The additional Skill State duration is mostly QoL and isn’t used for the
      numerical evaluation of this Constellation.


      *Individual Increase: 25%*

      *Total Increase from C0: 70%*
