      **Ascension 1 Passive: Galefeather Pursuit**
    description: >-
      All party members will gain additional CRIT Rate to their Plunging Attacks
      for 20s based on how many enemies are hit by Xianyun’s Driftcloud Wave
      Plunging Attack. It increases the party’s Plunging Attack CRIT Rate by
      4/6/8/10% depending on how many enemies are hit, which is a quite
      miniscule increase for single-target scenarios, while for multi-target
      scenarios it is an alright increase. Each stack of CRIT Rate is calculated
      independently, allowing Xianyun to gain additional stacks if her Skill is
      used multiple times per rotation.
