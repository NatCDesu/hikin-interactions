    description:
      "Freminet’s kit opens up the possibility for different playstyles.
      With this, the amount of combo variations that can be executed also increases.
      For this FAQ, however, only the combos that are performed during Freminet’s Burst
      state will be discussed. Note that more testing is needed to determine specific
      optimal combos for Freminet, but they all aim to maximize the Physical/Cryo MVs.
      \n\nFor his Physical playstyle, EN2E is by far the most optimal combo to reach
      Level 4 Shattering Pressure while maximizing the Physical MVs. You can weave a
      N1 in between the combos to fill the downtime of his Skill and continue to deal
      Physical damage.\n\nAs for his Cryo playstyle, N1EE will suffice to dish out as
      much Cryo DMG as possible without having too much cooldown time between his Skill
      casts by interweaving Normal Attacks in between.\n\nNote that upon casting Freminet’s
      Skill, it is recommended to cast his Burst immediately after so as to maximize
      its CD reset."
