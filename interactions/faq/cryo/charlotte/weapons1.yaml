      **Prototype Amber**
    description: >-
      Easily Charlotte’s most recommended weapon, giving her additional healing
      to help keep the team alive and well while also contributing to other
      buffs that come with HP change and / or healing, such as OHC. Furthermore,
      it also refunds her 18 Energy every burst at R5, helping her cut into what
      may seem like extremely daunting ER requirements for herself.

      An alternative for Charlotte if you still find yourself struggling with
      Energy even after Prototype Amber and / or your team is struggling with
      Energy. With a Burst hitting up to 8 times, Charlotte should have no
      issues proccing this weapon even with minimal CRIT Rate, although more
      CRIT Rate from substats would still help.
