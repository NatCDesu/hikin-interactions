      **Normal Attack: Cool-Color Capture**
    description: >-
      With her camera, Charlotte attacks the enemy by snapping shots (not to be
      confused with snapshotting!) of them up to three times in a row. While
      aesthetically pleasing to look at, Charlotte’s Normal Attacks are not very
      useful in her overall kit, being a non-factor in most cases outside of the
      Pneuma Thorn on her Charged Attack.

      *CD: **12s***


      Charlotte’s Skill functions similarly to how Nahida’s skill works. If
      tapped, it applies **Snappy Silhouette** on up to five enemies in front of
      her, dealing damage every 1.5s for 6s at a time. Her held Skill is a
      slightly longer variation of her tapped Skill, applying **Focused
      Impression** on up to five enemies and dealing damage every 1.5s lasting
      for 12s.

      Do note that there is a slight caveat to using her held Skill, being that
      Charlotte must have her skill Held for roughly two seconds before the
      viewfinder expands to its maximum size for it to count as ‘Focused
      Impression’ instead of ‘Snappy Silhouette’.
