  - title: "**Elemental Skill: Pressurized Floe**"
    description:
      "*CD : **10s***\n\nThe star of Freminet’s kit. Pressurized Floe deals
      coordinated Cryo attacks and increases the Pressure level of Pers Time to boost
      the damage of his final attack, Shattering Pressure.\n\nCasting Freminet’s Skill
      will cause a pressure bar to appear over his right shoulder, and his next four
      Normal Attacks will each be followed by a single coordinated Cryo attack. After
      first casting his Skill, the Pressure level of Pers Time will be at zero. For
      each Normal Attack he performs, the Pressure level increases by one. \n\nShattering
      Pressure is one of the biggest aspects of Freminet’s kit, and is tied closely
      to Pers Time’s Pressure level. It can be triggered either by completing four Normal
      Attacks or by activating his Skill again, which will end his Skill state early.
      When Shattering Pressure is triggered, it will deal Cryo damage, Physical damage,
      or a combination of the two. At Level 0, Shattering Pressure deals exclusively
      Cryo damage. As the Pressure level of Pers Timer increases, the amount of Cryo
      damage dealt decreases while the amount of Physical damage dealt increases. When
      it reaches Level 4 Shattering Pressure, the highest level, it deals purely Physical
      damage and ends his Skill state.\n\nFreminet’s Skill also introduces the new Arkhe
      alignment type, Pneuma, in the form of Spiritbreath Thorns. The intermittent Thorn
      damage will deal Cryo damage and release Pneuma energy to induce mekas’ emergency
      states. Freminet can also use his Skill to interact with the other Arkhe alignment
      type, Ousia, to solve overworld puzzles in Fontaine."

  - title: "**Elemental Burst: Shadowhunter’s Ambush**"
    description: |-
      *CD : **15s**
      Energy Cost : **60***

      Casting Freminet’s Burst will reset his Skill’s cooldown, and for the Burst’s 10s duration, will send him into the Subnautical Hunter mode. During this state, Freminet’s Skill cooldown time is reduced by 70% and the damage of his Skill’s Cryo coordinated attacks is doubled. For every Normal Attack performed under both his Skill and Burst states, the Pressure level will increase by 2, allowing Freminet to reach Level 4 Shattering Pressure with only two Normal Attacks instead of the usual four. Paired with his Burst’s Skill CD reduction, Freminet will be able to reach Level 4 Shattering Pressure more frequently.
