  - title: __EPILOGUE...?__
    description: >-
      In the deepest canals of the Genshin TC community, there have been
      whimpers, complaints, cries for a savior. “But I want Charlotte to be my
      DPS! I want to see her cool animations and use my favorite character more
      than simply a backline character. Is there *any* way she could deal
      damage?”


      What if I told you she does more damage than Dehya?


      Now, sure you might say “well basically anyone can,” but Charlotte was
      always meant to be a dedicated healer. She has extremely low multipliers
      and most of her kit enhances her healing. Dehya ***was*** meant to be,
      well, *some kind* of DPS. What makes Charlotte able to function as a
      dedicated DPS? *A Cryo Catalyst weapon.*


      This build is hyperspecific, and to some, may come off as uninteresting,
      but the work originally done for a meme has led to surprising results.

      ### __***Assumes Charlotte is Constellation 6***__

      **Team:** Bennett C5+, Kazuha, Xiangling

      **Artifact Set:** 4pc Shimenawa’s Reminiscence (Gilded Dreams is a decent
      substitute)

      **Artifact Stats:** EM, DMG%, CRIT

      **5-Star Weapon:** Cashflow Supervision

      **4-Star Weapon:** The Widsith R5 or Solar Pearl R5

      **Rotation (Charlotte):** hE, 4x(N2C)

      **Best Cons:** 6, 3, 2


      With all the Pyro application from Bennett, Kazuha, and Xiangling, it is
      easy to reach the maximum possible Reverse-Melts (13). This, combined with
      cramming loads of buffs into Charlotte, makes her stronger than a lot of
      characters you would force into Xiangling teams just to be able to play
      them in the first place.


      Is Charlotte the best choice for a Cryo user? *Absolutely not.* Kaeya and
      Rosaria are both superior, and one is even totally free. Any other Cryo or
      Hydro Catalyst character will probably outperform Charlotte, but… 

      1. Charlotte is cute.

      2. Using her in National breaks 40k team DPS

      3. *Charlotte is cute.*


      It is not recommended to use Shenhe and go Mono-Cryo. It is also not
      recommended to use Shenhe + Kazuha + Bennett. This is because most of
      Charlotte’s damage comes from her many reactions spread across her kit,
      and she needs as much Pyro application from teammates as humanly possible.
      Additionally, Mono-Cryo teams currently do not have the same buffing
      potential that Bennett + 13 Melts has.


      Dehya, in her best cases, does not hit 14k DPS, and she is a 5-star unit
      designed to deal damage.

      Charlotte, in her best case, hits ***15k DPS in her worst case.***


      Keep in mind that assumptions are fairly optimistic, as sim and sheets
      can’t properly account for the application in practice. It’d be safe to
      expect somewhat less in gameplay.


      I hope Charlotte lovers everywhere can rejoice today, in some small
      amount.


      Until next time,

      Emi
