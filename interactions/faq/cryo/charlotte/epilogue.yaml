  - title: __EPILOGUE...?__
    description: >-
      In the deepest canals of the Genshin TC community, there have been
      whimpers, complaints, cries for a savior. “But I want Charlotte to be my
      DPS! I want to see her cool animations and use my favorite character more
      than simply a backline character. Is there *any* way she could deal
      damage?”


      Well, if you think “marginally more DPS than Dehya” is good, I have good
      news for you!


      Now, sure you might say “well basically anyone can get more,” but
      Charlotte was always meant to be a dedicated healer. She has extremely low
      multipliers and most of her kit enhances her healing. Dehya ***was***
      meant to be *some kind* of DPS. What makes Charlotte able to function as a
      dedicated DPS? *A Cryo Catalyst weapon.*


      This build is hyperspecific, and to some, may come off as uninteresting,
      but the work originally done for a meme has led to surprising results. 


      ***Assumes Charlotte is Constellation 6***

      **Team:** Bennett C5+, Lynette, Xiangling (Kazuha cannot swirl Cryo in
      this team consistently)

      **Artifact Set:** 4pc Shimenawa’s Reminiscence (Gilded Dreams is a decent
      substitute)

      **Artifact Stats:** EM, DMG%, CRIT

      **5-Star Weapon:** A Thousand Floating Dreams (ATK% Sands) or Cashflow
      Supervision (EM Sands)

      **4-Star Weapon:** The Widsith R5 or Solar Pearl R5

      **Rotation (Charlotte): N2C, swap, hE, 3x(N2C)

      **Best Cons:** 6, 3, 2
       
      With all the Pyro application from Bennett, Kazuha, and Xiangling, it is
      easy to reach the maximum possible Reverse-Melts (13). This, combined with
      cramming loads of buffs into Charlotte, makes her stronger than a lot of
      characters you would force into Xiangling teams just to be able to play
      them in the first place.


      Is Charlotte the best choice for a Cryo user? *Absolutely not.* Kaeya and
      Rosaria are both superior, and one is even totally free. Any other Cryo or
      Hydro Catalyst character will probably outperform Charlotte. But she’s
      cute, so it’s okay.


      It is not recommended to use Shenhe and go Mono-Cryo. It is also not
      recommended to use Shenhe + Kazuha + Bennett. This is because most of
      Charlotte’s damage comes from her many reactions spread across her kit,
      and she needs as much Pyro application from teammates as humanly possible.
      Additionally, Mono-Cryo teams currently do not have the same buffing
      potential that Bennett + 13 Melts has.


      Keep in mind that assumptions are fairly optimistic, as sim and sheets
      can’t properly account for the application in practice. It’d be safe to
      expect somewhat less in gameplay.
