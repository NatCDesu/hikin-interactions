      To make full use of Charlotte’s healing capabilities, you will want to
      stack as much ATK as possible on Charlotte while meeting ER requirements,
      while equipping an HB circlet. While this build means that Charlotte’s
      personal damage will be completely irrelevant, it maximizes the potency of
      her healing, keeping the party safe and healthy.


      If you are interested in playing Charlotte as a DPS, please consider the
      final section authored by Emiliabyss.

      Easiest means of giving Charlotte quick boosts to her healing while
      helping to ease her often ridiculously high ER requirements. If
      Charlotte’s teammates do not make use of ATK, this is the recommended
      approach to take for building her.

      At C0, Charlotte will more than easily cap out a bubble, but that’s all
      the output you’re getting out of her aside from Prototype Amber’s healing.
      Constellations give her a bit more sustained healing, which makes it
      easier for subsequent bubbles to do more damage.
