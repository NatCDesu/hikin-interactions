      **Constellation 1 - A Need to Verify Facts**
    description: >-
      > *After Still Photo: Comprehensive Confirmation heals a character, it
      will mark them with Verification, which will heal them once every 2s for
      80% of Charlotte's ATK. This effect lasts 6s.*


      Further heals party members that were healed by Charlotte’s Burst with an
      effect similar to Prototype Amber’s. A pretty noticeable increase in
      healing for a Constellation 1, which should be relatively accessible,
      particularly for people who wish to roll for Furina’s Constellations as
      well. This Constellation is also very useful for continued triggering of
      effects that proc on HP change / healing, such as Furina’s Burst stacks or
      Ocean-Hued Clam’s damage. A solid Constellation all-around.

      > *When using Framing: Freezing Point Composition, when Monsieur Verite
      hits 1/2/3 (or more) opponents, Charlotte's own ATK will be increased by
      10%/20%/30% for 12s.*


      When Charlotte’s Skill instances hit enemies, she will be buffed up to 30%
      ATK depending on the number of enemies hit by her Skill, increasing her
      overall damage and personal healing.


      Note: Further Constellation increases are based on the highest possible
      increase.
