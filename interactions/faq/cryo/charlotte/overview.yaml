      *Pre-TC is volatile and, as always, perpetually subject to change
      until release (and sometimes later!). Please note that these are
      theoretical suggestions. 

      Everything described in this FAQ is a good faith analysis based on the
      little information about the character’s kit that we know. Team calcs,
      additionally, are not established yet, and as with everything in TC,
      the content in this FAQ should be taken with a grain of salt.*

- title: __OVERVIEW__
  description: Freminet is a 4-star Cryo, Pneuma-aligned, on-field Claymore DPS whose
    unique A4 passive allows him to amplify his Skill’s Cryo and Physical damage with
    the help of the Shatter reaction. His kit opens up novel and viable team compositions
    that were once considered suboptimal due to Claymores’ heavy attacks dismissing
    most of the benefits of Freeze teams. Freminet can be played to maximize either  his
    Physical or his Cryo damage, with each playstyle changing his preferred equipment,
    teams, and combos, all of which will be discussed in the following sections.
