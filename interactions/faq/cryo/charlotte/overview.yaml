          *Pre-TC is volatile and, as always, perpetually subject to change
          until release (and sometimes later!). Please note that these are
          theoretical suggestions.

          Everything described in this FAQ is a good faith analysis based on the
          little information about the characterâ€™s kit that we know. Team calcs,
          additionally, are not established yet, and as with everything in TC,
          the content in this FAQ should be taken with a grain of salt.*

  - title: __OVERVIEW__
    description: >-
      Charlotte is a 4-star Cryo, Pneuma-aligned Catalyst user. She has a decent
      amount of off-field Cryo Application, but where she truly shines is in her
      healing, which, before Constellation 6, comes primarily from her Burst. As
      such, it is essential that one builds Charlotte with sufficient Energy to
      Burst every rotation, especially if she is not being used in a Perma
      Freeze team composition.
