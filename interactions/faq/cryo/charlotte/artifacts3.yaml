      **4PC Blizzard Strayer**
    description:
      4pc Blizzard Strayer outmatches other sets for Cryo Freminet because
      of its valuable 20% CRIT increase when fighting against enemies affected by Cryo.
      Unfortunately, due to his Shatter-based kit, he cannot make use of the additional
      20% CRIT Rate buff against Frozen enemies.

  - title: "**2PC Cryo + 2PC ER/ATK**"
    description:
      Should a 4pc BS set be unavailable, combinations of 2pc Cryo with ER
      and ATK-based sets works as adequate substitutes. Similar to his Physical build,
      pairing 2pc Cryo with 2pc ER is only recommended if the other options lack ER
      substats and if it provides decent CRIT substats. That being said, 2pc ER’s value
      still diminishes as Cryo Freminet usually needs less ER to begin with.

  - title: "**4PC Golden Troupe**"
    description: |-
      Since Freminet casts his Skill more often in his Cryo playstyle, 4pc Golden Troupe becomes a viable option for its massive 45% Elemental Skill DMG boost. However, as Freminet has no off-field damage potential, he cannot make full use of the 4pc set effect’s additional 25% Skill DMG.

      As Freminet can only use Golden Troupe on his Cryo build and cannot make good use of Marechaussee Hunter, it is not recommended to farm 4pc GT specifically for Freminet, since Blizzard Strayer performs better for his Cryo build anyway. 4pc GT only becomes a resin-efficient pick for Freminet if you are already farming the domain for other characters who can fully maximize its set’s effects.
