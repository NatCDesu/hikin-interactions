      It is highly recommended that you go with one of the two weapons above,
      since they are easily accessible, with Prototype Amber being a craftable
      weapon and helping significantly even at lower refinements. If, however,
      you insist on going for something else, here are a few suggestions.

      A very expensive option for Charlotte, one may opt to use this on her in a
      team that could appreciate the EM, like a Reverse Melt team. Not
      recommended for most teams.

      Although the substat does not help Charlotte in most of her teams, the
      extra skill charge could go a long way to helping her resolve her Energy
      issues, although once again, you would rather go with one of the
      recommended weapons instead.

      Still everybody’s favorite 3★ Catalyst, TTDS makes its return. Do note
      though that this would mean that Charlotte would need to be played in an
      environment that can support her high ER requirements while ensuring that
      she goes before the main carry in the team.
