      **Song of Broken Pines**
    description:
      Amazing weapon when on a Physical build. Its ATK buff and Normal ATK
      SPD increase boost his Normal Attack damage and allows him to gain Pressure levels
      slightly quicker. However, with the Skill CD reduction only available in Burst
      form, the Bonus ATK SPD hardly increases the combo speed by a large amount.

    description: Mainly a CRIT stat stick as Freminet cannot make good use of its passive.

    description:
      A good free-to-play option. The Dragonspine claymore is mainly a stat
      stick for its Physical DMG Bonus secondary stat. Though Freminet does make great
      use of its passive, Starsilver’s passive isn’t very amazing to begin with.

    description:
      Another craftable option. Can be utilized by both Physical and Cryo
      playstyles.
