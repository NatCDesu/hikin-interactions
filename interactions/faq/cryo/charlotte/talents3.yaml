      *CD: **20s***

      *Energy cost: **80***


      The highlight of Charlotte’s kit, her Burst creates a **Newsflash Field**
      that heals the entire party upon cast. It also does up to eight instances
      of damage to enemies within the field while healing active character(s)
      with every attack. Although the Burst damage by itself is nothing to write
      home about, both the cast as well as the continuous healing from her Burst
      are pretty good at baseline, and will only be improved with
      Constellations.

      **Ascension 1 Passive: Moment of Impact**
    description: >-
      When enemies marked by Charlotte’s held Skill are defeated, it reduces the
      cooldown of her Skill by 2s, up to four times for a total of 8s. While on
      paper this may seem to be a good thing, it also means that you would have
      to take the time to use her held Skill, which might be a bit of a bad
      thing if your aim is to clear chambers as quickly as possible.

      On the other hand, this Constellation also means that Charlotte will have
      the ability to recast her Skill on a subsequent wave in multi-wave
      content, granting the party more healing along with helping out with her
      own Energy. Weigh the pros and cons of this carefully.

  - title: '**Ascension 4 Passive: Diversified Investigation**'
    description: >-
      This passive increases Charlotte’s healing for every Fontainian party
      member other than herself, while non-Fontainian party members increase her
      Cyro DMG% instead.

      The first part of this passive is pretty useful for Charlotte, especially
      considering that most Fontainian characters have some sort of
      HP-manipulation ability, helping her keep them alive with more ease. On
      the other hand, while niche, people who would like to experiment with
      Charlotte as a carry might like the second part, especially considering
      that most of her best buffers (eg. Kazuha, Shenhe) are non-Fontainian.

      A neat little passive with a gadget that is exclusive to Charlotte,
      obtainable from the 4.2 event “Graph Adversarial Technology Experiment
      Log”. Below is a transcript from the 4.2 livestream on how to use it:


      *To use it, just equip the Kamera and activate the Zoom Lens in your
      inventory. The Zoom Lens can be attached to all Kameras obtained in the
      game up to this point. When equipped with other characters, the Zoom Lens
      won’t be able to be used in combat. But… If you switch to Charlotte and
      hold her Elemental Skill, you’ll be able to snap pics with Zoom Lens even
      while fighting! You can even use it in Domains!*
