      **Ascension 1 Passive: Saturation Deep Dive**
    description:
      Freminet’s A1 passive further shortens his Skill cooldown so long as
      he performs a Shattering Pressure lower than Level 4. This allows Freminet to
      churn out more instances of Shattering Pressure, and is a crucial boost to his
      Cryo playstyle.

    description:
      Freminet’s A4 is what makes his kit and playstyle completely different
      from any other in the game. It actively encourages players to pair him with an
      off-field Hydro applicator to make the most of the Shatter reaction, which has
      formerly been seen as a downside to having Claymore characters in Freeze teams.
      Now, Shatter provides a sizable DMG boost to Freminet’s Skill and introduces new,
      viable team compositions.
