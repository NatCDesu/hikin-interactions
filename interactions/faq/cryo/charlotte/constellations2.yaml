      > *Increases the Level of Normal Attack: Flowing Eddies by 3.
      > Maximum upgrade level is 15.*

      This is the first time a 4-star character’s Constellation 3 increases the level of their Normal Attacks — which says something about how integral they are to Freminet’s kit. Normal Attacks are frequently and prominently used to build his Pressure levels, and so this Constellation provides a welcome boost to his damage. Freminet’s C3 benefits his Physical playstyle more than his Cryo one since he interweaves more Normal Attacks in his Burst combos.

      > *When Freminet triggers Frozen, Shatter, or Superconduct against opponents, his ATK will be increased by 9% for 6s. Max 2 stacks. This can be triggered once every 0.3s.*

      As most of Freminet’s teams allows him to trigger any or all of these reactions consistently, his C4 essentially provides him with an additional 18% ATK with a high uptime.
