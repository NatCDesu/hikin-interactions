      This Constellation increases her Burst levels, which, being the source of
      all her healing, is a very welcome increase.

      > *When Still Photo: Comprehensive Confirmation hits an opponent marked by
      Snappy Silhouette or Focused Impression, it will deal 10% more DMG and
      restore 2 Energy to Charlotte. This restoration can be triggered 5 times
      every 20s.*


      Enemies marked by Charlotte’s Skill receive increased damage from her
      Burst. Additionally, every time they do so, Charlotte gets a bit of her
      Energy back, up to 10 every Skill use. A solid Constellation, helping
      alleviate Charlotte’s Energy issues, being especially noticeable if
      Charlotte is used as a solo Cryo.
