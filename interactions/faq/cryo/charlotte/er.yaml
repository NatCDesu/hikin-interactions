    description: >-
      Solo Cryo assumes a 25-second rotation, with Charlotte doing 2 tapped
      Skills per Burst every rotation.

      Double and Triple Cryo assume a 21-second rotation, with Charlotte doing
      one fully held Skill per Burst every rotation.


      Each Favonius proc lowers Charlotte’s ER requirements by ~13%.

      Charlotte’s C4 helps to further reduce her ER Requirements by up to ~25%.


      Energy requirements will vary based on your team and rotation. For a more
      accurate estimate, please use the Energy Recharge calculator linked
