      Partywide ATK on Burst, which not only benefits her ATK-scaling teammates,
      but Charlotte herself too in terms of both damage and healing.

      Although HP doesn’t do anything for Charlotte’s healing, the ATK from
      having her skill damage opponents from off-field could be a good
      consistent source of partywide ATK. That being said, this would mean that
      her held Skill is almost always a necessity to use, or this is a dead set.

      Boosting Charlotte’s already enormous healing numbers, this set might be
      overkill for her, and you might prefer having something else that will
      give her more utility to aid the team in other ways. Would not recommend
      specifically farming / strongboxing for this set, so only use it if you
      have excess pieces saved from farming Viridescent Venerer.
