      **4PC Pale Flame**
    description:
      4pc Pale Flame is by far the best set for Physical Freminet. With his
      Burst combo’s frequent Skill casts, Freminet is able to maintain uptime on PF’s
      4pc set effect and retain its ATK% and Physical DMG% buffs.

  - title: "**2PC Physical + 2PC ER/Physical/ATK**"
    description:
      Any of these 2pc combos perform slightly worse than 4pc Pale Flame,
      but are much easier to obtain and farm than a full PF set. These should serve
      as decent transitional artifacts should you wish to farm for a full PF set. 2pc
      EoSF is only a viable option over 2pc PF if there is a lack of ER substats and
      if it provides him with decent CRIT substats. Although building Freminet with
      2pc EM has some potential should the pieces have decent substats, it is not recommended
      to build him with EM artifacts as his kit does not buff Shatter damage and only
      relies on it to boost his Cryo and Physical damage.
