      ### Charlotte | Hydro | Cryo | Anemo

      Practically a staple consideration for any off-field Cryo support, Freeze
      teams really appreciate Charlotte’s off-field Cryo application and
      healing, especially if the Hydro option in the team is Furina. Even
      without considering Furina though, having Charlotte in the healer slot
      means that players can afford to run more offensive Hydro options such as
      Ayato and / or Mona, although if one is already comfortable with Kokomi,
      then Charlotte’s personal value drops a lot.

      ### Charlotte | Shenhe | Cryo | Anemo

      Another Cryo-centric team composition, this team trades a bit of the
      safety that comes from perma-freeze for damage courtesy of Shenhe’s buffs
      to Cryo teams. Running 3 Cryo characters also means that the team will
      have very high Cryo particle generation, helping with Charlotte’s ER
      issues rather noticeably.

      ### Charlotte | Physical Carry | Electro Flex | Flex

      Physical teams revolve around supporting a physical carry via means of
      Superconduct and other buffs being stacked onto a physical carry taking
      the field to do damage. Though most characters outside of catalysts can
      _technically_ be built for physical damage, this slot is typically filled
      by either Eula or Freminet, and, to a certain degree, Razor.

      As such, unless the primary carry in question is Razor, one flex slot is
      often reserved for an off-field Electro character like Fischl, while the
      final flex slot can be changed depending on what you want / need.


      **__Teammates__**


      <:flex:1094549077280169984> **Physical options:** Eula / Freminet / Razor


      <:electro:1094545575992623115> **Electro Flex options:** Fischl / Raiden /
      Lisa


      <:flex:1094549077280169984> **Flex options:** Kaeya / Rosaria / Shenhe /
