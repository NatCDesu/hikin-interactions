      "### **Freminet | Shenhe | Hydro | Anemo**\nA unique way to play Freminet,
      this archetype makes use of his Burst’s Skill CD reduction to spam Pressurized
      Floe and deal multiple instances of Level 0 Shattering Pressure. Usually you want
      to play up to 3 Cryo characters, but with how Freminet’s kit interacts with Frozen
      and Shatter, an off-field Hydro applicator is much appreciated to boost Freminet’s
      personal damage. The last slot should still be an Anemo character to make full
      use of the 4pc VV effect. \n\nFreminet only benefits from his A4 passive if he
      himself triggers Shatter, so make sure to place any abilities that can Shatter
      (i.e. Zhongli’s pillar) away from enemies so as to avoid other units stealing
      Freminet’s Shatters.\n\n__**Teammates**__\n\n<:anemo:1094545726748508250> **Anemo
