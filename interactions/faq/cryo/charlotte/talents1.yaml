      __TALENT PRIORITY__

      **Elemental Burst > Elemental Skill**

      ## __Analysis__

      - As mentioned in the previous segment, all of Charlotte’s healing at
      lower Constellations comes from her Burst. Hence, in order to make the
      most out of her, her Burst should be prioritized heavily for leveling. Her
      Skill, on the other hand, only serves to apply Cryo off-field while
      outputting minute amounts of damage, making it much less important to
      level.
