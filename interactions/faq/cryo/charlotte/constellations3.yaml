      Sadly, this Constellation only benefits Charlotte’s Skill damage, which is
      not at all a major part of her kit if played as a healbot.

  - title: '**Constellation 6 - A Summation of Interest**'
    description: >-
      > *When the active character's Normal and Charged Attacks hit an opponent
      marked by Framing: Freezing Point Composition's Focused Impression,
      Monsieur Verite will initiate a follow-up attack that deals 180% of
      Charlotte's ATK as AoE Cryo DMG and heals active character(s) within the
      AoE for 42% of Charlotte's ATK. This effect can be triggered once every
      6s, and both DMG and healing done this way will be considered as having
      been done by Charlotte's Elemental Burst.*


      This Constellation allows Charlotte to trigger up to two follow-up attacks
      per Skill whenever active characters hit enemies marked by ‘Focused
      Impression’, dealing Cryo damage while healing the active character for a
      portion of Charlotte’s ATK. This gives Charlotte the ability to heal
      outside of her Burst, while also adding on a bit more damage to the team,
      further incentivizing people to use her held Skill. That being said,
      whether it’s worth to use held Skill for said reason is still up for
      debate, and being locked behind a Constellation 6 does not help its case
      either.
