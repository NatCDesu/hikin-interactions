      **General Healer**

      ### Charlotte | Flex | Flex | Flex

      Being a healer means that Charlotte can be slotted into virtually any team
      that would appreciate the sustain that she provides, bringing to the table
      a large chunk of healing from her Burst that only gets better with
      Constellations. That being said, there are a few teams that particularly

      ### Charlotte | Furina | Flex | Flex

      With Furina’s buffs proportional to the amount of HP change in the party,
      it should come to no surprise that Charlotte’s immense teamwide healing
      makes her one of Furina’s best friends, synergizing with her extremely
      well, with Charlotte being able to heal back most, if not all, of the HP
      that Furina drains with her Ousia Skill. This makes the two of them an
      extremely potent duo, boasting both immense buffing and survivability,
      allowing the player to fill in their teams with more offensive DPSs /
      Supports.


      While there are too many possible team compositions to discuss in detail
      here, the possibility of running the two of them may exist in the
      compositions that will be discussed in the succeeding sections.
