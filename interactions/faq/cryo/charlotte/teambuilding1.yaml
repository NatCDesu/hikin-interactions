      ### **Freminet | Hydro | Electro | Cryo/Flex**
      Freminet’s standard team. He wants an off-field Hydro unit to trigger the Frozen reaction for him to Shatter for his A4 passive, and an off-field Electro unit to trigger Superconduct and decrease enemies’ Physical RES. A Cryo battery is usually recommended to make sure Freminet can consistently cast his Burst without having to build too much Energy Recharge; however, you can also slot in a non-Cryo flex unit if your team has sufficient Energy generation.
