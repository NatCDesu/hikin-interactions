      **Constellation 1 - Terror for the Evildoers**
    description: >-
      > *The Gracious Rebuke from the Passive Talent "There Shall Be a Plea for
      Justice" is changed to this:

      > When Wriothesley's HP is less than 60% or while he is in the Chilling
      Penalty state caused by Icefang Rush, when the fifth attack of Repelling
      Fists hits, it will create a Gracious Rebuke. 1 Gracious Rebuke effect can
      be obtained every 2.5s.

      > 

      > Additionally, Rebuke: Vaulting Fist will obtain the following
      enhancement:

      > - The DMG Bonus gained will be further increased to 200%.

      > - When it hits while Wriothesley is in the Chilling Penalty state, that
      state's duration is extended by 4s. 1 such extension can occur per 1
      Chilling Penalty duration.

      > 

      > You must first unlock the Passive Talent "There Shall Be a Plea for
      Justice."*


      Arguably one of Wriothesley’s best Constellations. This shortens the long
      5-second cooldown of his Ascension 1 passive to 2.5 seconds, ensuring he
      gets healed through his enhanced Charged Attacks more frequently, while
      also giving it a massive buff. 


      After Wriothesley’s Vaulting Fist hits an enemy, the duration of the
      Chilling Penalty state will be extended by another 4 seconds, totaling its
      duration to 14 seconds (and can even get extended up to 16 seconds with
      hitlag extension). Nevertheless, it is usually not worth extending his
      field time since most buffs, such as VV, will run out before the Chilling
      Penalty state ends.

    description: >-
      > *When using Darkgold Wolfbite, each Prosecution Edict stack from the
      Passive Talent "There Shall Be a Reckoning for Sin'' will increase said
      ability's DMG dealt by 40%.

      > You must first unlock the Passive Talent "There Shall Be a Reckoning for
      Sin."*


      This turns Wriothesley’s Burst into a nuke after finishing his combo.
      However, it is still not worth building Energy Recharge to burst every
      rotation. Still a decent constellation nonetheless.
