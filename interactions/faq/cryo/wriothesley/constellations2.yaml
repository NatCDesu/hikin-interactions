      Wriothesley’s C3 provides a great boost to his Normal and Charged Attacks
      by increasing his Normal Attack’s Talent level.


      Unbuffed Cryo DPS Increase from C2: 16.69%


      Buffed Cryo DPS Increase from C2: 16.15%


      Reverse Melt DPS Increase from C2: 16.36%


      Unbuffed Cryo DPS Increase from C0: 57.06%


      Buffed Cryo DPS Increase from C0: 38.05%


      Reverse Melt DPS Increase from C0: 51.38%

      > *The HP restored to Wriothesley through Rebuke: Vaulting Fist will be
      increased to 50% of his Max HP. You must first unlock the Passive Talent
      "There Shall Be a Plea for Justice."

      > Additionally, when Wriothesley is healed, if the amount of healing
      overflows, the following effects will occur depending on whether he is on
      the field or not. If he is on the field, his ATK SPD will be increased by
      20% for 4s. If he is off-field, all party members' ATK SPD will be
      increased by 10% for 6s. These two methods of increasing ATK SPD cannot
      stack.*


      C4 will further ensure Wriothesley’s survivability by giving him even more
      healing through the Vaulting Fist. Additionally, overheal will increase
      Wriothesley’s ATK SPD when he is on-field, which shortens his combo. He
      can easily maintain this just by using his Vaulting Fist off cooldown.
      When he is off-field, overheal increases other character’s ATK SPD
      instead.


      Unbuffed Cryo DPS Increase from C3: 9.02%


      Buffed Cryo DPS Increase from C3: 8.13%


      Reverse Melt DPS Increase from C3: 10.83%


      Unbuffed Cryo DPS Increase from C0: 71.22%


      Buffed Cryo DPS Increase from C0: 49.28%
