    **Quicken**
  description: "### Sethos | Electro | Dendro | Flex\nThe most effective team for
    Sethos regardless of the playstyle used as other options are either not recommended
    or are niche. Sethos needs an Electro battery to aid his ER requirements, along
    with a Dendro character required to trigger Quicken reactions. Buffers, healers,
    and shielders can take up the last slot in this team. Sethos generally does not
    take up a lot of field time with him being a Quickswap DPS, therefore making the
    rotations quite short.\n\n__**Teammates**__\n\n<:electro:1094545575992623115>
    **Electro options:**\n- **Fischl:** Generates massive amounts of Energy for Sethos
    along with significant off-field damage.\n- **Yae:** Takes up a similar role as
    Fischl, albeit generates less Energy than her.\n- **Kuki:** Provides healing along
    with a decent amount of Energy. The range on her Skill, however, requires Sethos
    to be closer to the enemy when fighting.\n- **C6 Sara:** A buffer which, at C6,
    gives Sethos a 60% CRIT DMG increase. Sethos’ short field time does not make the
    6s duration of the buff much of an issue, however, Sara does not have good Energy
    generation and her Flat ATK buff is not as effective due to Sethos’ EM scalings.\n\n<:dendro:1094441547170316359>
    **Dendro options:**\n- **Baizhu:** Provides healing and shielding along with a
    DMG Bonus buff for Aggravate from his A4 Passive. However, his Burst can only
    be used once every other rotation due to its CD being quite long compared to the
    shorter rotation duration of this team. \n- **Nahida:** Provides a massive EM
    buff for Sethos along with significant off-field damage. Although keep in mind
    that since she applies so much Dendro, it makes Swirling Electro quite difficult.\n-
    **Kirara:** Provides a shield with stronger interruption resistance than Baizhu’s,
    along with just enough Dendro application to comfortably Swirl Electro.\n- **Yaoyao:**
    Provides healing and Dendro application.\n\n<:flex:1094549077280169984> **Flex
    options:**\n- **Sucrose:** Holds 4pc VV and provides a massive amount of EM for
    Sethos. Can also equip Hakushin Ring to provide Elemental DMG Bonus.\n- **Kazuha:**
    Takes up a similar role as Sucrose, although his buff is for Elemental DMG% instead
    of EM and he cannot equip Hakushin Ring.\n- **Zhongli:** Provides a very strong
    shield along with 20% Elemental RES Shred."

- title: "**Overloaded (Not Recommended)**"
  description: Overloaded teams, even with Chevreuse, are generally not recommended
    due to various reasons. Sethos’ damage depends mostly on his EM scalings, rendering
    Bennett’s ATK buff mostly ineffective. The inconsistent triggering of reactions
    means that Sethos’ EM scaling cannot contribute as much, and he cannot reliably
    gain the 12 Flat Energy from his Skill every rotation, which is very much needed
    for both of his playstyles.
