- title: __ENERGY RECHARGE REQUIREMENTS__
  description: "Generally, Sethos’ ER requirements are too high to be usable in teams
    where he is the only Electro unit. \nFavonius weapons decrease Sethos’ ER requirements
    by ~10-20% per proc.\n\nIf you choose to not modify rotations and use Sethos’
    C6 as a means to decrease ER requirements rather than fire additional Level 2
    Charged Shots, his ER requirements are lowered by ~40-80% for his Aimed Shot playstyle
    only. This also applies to rotations pre-C6 where Sethos only fires 3 Aimed Shots.\n\nSethos’s
    ER requirements will vary based on your team and rotation. For a more accurate
    estimate, please use the Energy Recharge Calculator linked [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-vkmgp5n0bI9pvhUg110Aza3Emb2puLWdeoCgrxDlu4/copy).\nFor
    more details on how Favonius weapons will affect your team, please use Ac1d’s
