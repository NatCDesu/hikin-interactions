    **Ascension 1 Passive: Black Kite's Enigma**
  description: Sethos’ Level 2 Charged Attack normally takes a whopping 6s to be fully
    charged. This is where his A1 Passive comes in, reducing the charge time at the
    cost of his Energy. For each Energy point Sethos has, it reduces his charge time
    by 0.285s. The charge time can be reduced until it’s only 0.3s long and the maximum
    amount of Energy that can be consumed is 20, which effectively removes his ability
    to use his Burst when using his Aimed Shot playstyle.
