    **Hunter’s Path**
  description: Sethos’ premium weapon of choice and best weapon, though not by much
    at R1. Hunter’s Path synergizes perfectly with Sethos, providing him plenty of
    desirable stats - CRIT Value, Elemental DMG Bonus, and a passive that works similarly
    to his Ascension 4 Passive / Elemental Burst, depending on which playstyle you
    decide to go with.

- title: "**Slingshot**"
  description: Do not be fooled by this weapon’s rarity; Slingshot is most definitely
    Sethos’ 2nd best weapon. Since this weapon is easily obtainable from gacha, one
    should have no issue getting it to R5, where they get a whopping 60% DMG Bonus
    to their Charged Shots, complimenting Sethos’ kit amazingly. If you do not wish
    to get Hunter’s Path for Sethos / you don’t have it at the moment, this is what
    you should aim for.

- title: "**The First Great Magic / Aqua Simulacra**"
  description: At R1, these weapons’ performances are similar, if not straight up
    worse, than R5 Slingshot. Not worth pulling these weapons specifically for Sethos.
