    **Hunter’s Path**
  description: Sethos’s premium weapon of choice, Hunter’s Path synergizes perfectly
    with Sethos, providing him plenty of desirable stats - CRIT Value, Elemental DMG%
    Bonus, and a passive that works similarly to his Ascension 4 Passive / Elemental
    Burst, depending on which playstyle you decide to go with. His best weapon by
    a noticeable margin.

- title: "**Slingshot**"
  description: Do not be fooled by this weapon’s rarity; Slingshot is most definitely
    Sethos’s 2nd best weapon. Since this weapon is easily obtainable from gacha, one
    should have no issue getting it to R5, where they get a whopping 60% DMG Bonus
    to their Charged Shots, complimenting Sethos’s kit amazingly. If you do not wish
    to get Hunter’s Path for Sethos / you don’t have it at the moment, this is what
    you should aim for.

- title: "**The First Great Magic / Aqua Simulacra**"
  description: These weapons have performance that is similar, if not straight up
    worse, than R5 Slingshot at R1. Not worth pulling these weapons specifically for
    Sethos.
