    Sethos will only use an ER Sands in teams where his ER needs are notably high. Otherwise an EM Sands is preferred.

    **Substats:** ER until requirement > CRIT Rate/DMG > EM > ATK%

    **4pc Wanderer’s Troupe**
  description: Wanderer’s Troupe is Sethos’ best set, providing both EM and an unconditional
    CA DMG Bonus. This is especially useful as Charged Attacks make up the vast majority
    of Sethos’ damage.

- title: "**4pc Gilded Dreams**"
  description: Sethos cares mostly for the high EM it provides, as he scales on EM
    in multiple areas. The ATK% is still helpful but less noteworthy.

- title: "**2pc EM/ATK%/ER%/Electro DMG% combos**"
  description: Unconditional mixed set options. They are not much worse than 4pc Gilded
    Dreams. Players with a good mixed set do not necessarily need to farm for the
    aforementioned 4pc sets.

- title: "**4pc Desert Pavilion Chronicle**"
  description: Only used for Sethos’ Burst-NA playstyle, this set has more CA DMG
    Bonus than Wanderer’s Troupe, but lacks the EM. This being said, the ATK SPD increase
    can lead to Sethos being able to hit more times during his Burst, which can make
    it roughly equal to Wanderer’s Troupe.
