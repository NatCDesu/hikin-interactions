    ## __Analysis__
    - Since Sethos is mainly involved within Quicken teams, leveling him to 90 should be prioritized as well. His Normal Attack Talent multipliers are involved in both playstyles, therefore it is recommended to prioritize leveling this Talent.
    - Sethos’ Burst can only be used when doing his Normal Attack playstyle. His Burst provides a significant DMG increase to his Normal Attacks, therefore it should be leveled up along with his Normal Attack Talent, otherwise it becomes optional if the Aimed Shot playstyle is preferred.
    - Sethos’ Skill does not contribute to his damage much and the Flat Energy his Skill provides is a fixed value regardless of Talent Level, therefore leveling it is optional.
