    __TALENT PRIORITY__

    **Elemental Skill > Elemental Burst >> Normal Attack**
  description: |-
    ## __Analysis__
    - Level 90 is beneficial for Clorinde since she is triggering incidental Hyperblooms or Aggravate.
    - Clorinde’s Electro-infused Normal Attacks, which are her main source of damage, scale from her Elemental Skill Talent and not her Normal Attack Talent, therefore it is recommended to prioritize leveling her Skill. There is no need to level her Normal Attack Talent.
    - It is also recommended to level her Burst after her Skill, not only for additional damage, but also due to the Bond of Life Clorinde grants herself scaling with the Burst Talent Level.
