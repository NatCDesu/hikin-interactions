    <:sands:1094559345364185119> *Sands of Eon:* ATK% / EM

    At C0, ATK% and EM sands perform about the same if Clorinde is triggering Hyperbloom. Without Hyperbloom ATK% sands is slightly preferable. Any Constellation above C0 will prefer ATK% sands over EM.

    **Substats:** CRIT > ATK% > EM/ER

    **4pc Fragment of Harmonic Whimsy**
  description: Generally Clorinde’s highest personal damage set, especially at higher
    Constellations.

- title: "**4pc Thundering Fury**"
  description: This set is used when shortening Clorinde’s cooldowns is more beneficial
    than increasing her personal damage. An example of an ideal 4pc TF team is Clorinde-Furina-Nahida-Fischl,
    where Nahida and Furina have long-lasting deployable Skills/Bursts. Clorinde can
    swap off once to refresh Oz and then go back to being on-field. 4pc TF is not
    recommended for pure Electro-Charged teams.

- title: "**4pc Gladiator's Finale**"
  description: A fine budget option to use before farming for 4pc FHW. Roughly 10%
    less personal damage compared to FHW which is not too bad considering Quickbloom
    teams do not need her to do outstanding damage.
