    __TALENT OVERVIEW__

    **Normal Attack: Oath of Hunting Shadows**
  description: Clorinde’s regular Normal Attacks are nothing special to look at. Instead,
    Clorinde’s Electro-infused pistolet attacks during her special state on her Skill
    are her main source of damage and will be further discussed in the Elemental Skill
    section.

  description: "*CD: **16s***\n\nClorinde enters a special state called Night Vigil
    state. In this state, her Normal Attacks become Electro-infused pistolet attacks
    and her Skill becomes a lunging attack that is considered as Normal Attack DMG.
    Clorinde summons a single Ousia blade along with her infused Normal Attacks. During
    this state, Clorinde does not receive healing from external sources, instead the
    external healing is converted to Bond of Life. The percentage of healing that
    converts to her Bond of Life is 80%. This state lasts for 7.5s and automatically
    ends when Clorinde leaves the field.\n\nClorinde gains different effects depending
    on her Bond of Life value when performing the infused Normal Attacks and lunging
    attack. Upon using her infused Normal Attacks, if her Bond of Life value is less
    than 100% of her Max HP, her infused Normal Attacks  deal increased damage,pierce
    through enemies, and grant Clorinde a 35% BoL . Otherwise, when her Bond of Life
    value is equal to or greater than 100%, she just performs her weaker infused Normal
    Attacks. \n\nUpon using her lunging attack, if she has a Bond of Life less than
    100% of her Max HP, Clorinde is healed based on her Bond of Life value, while
    her lunging attack gains an AoE and DMG increase. If her Bond of Life value is
    equal to or greater than 100%, the healing she gains and her lunging attack’s
    AoE and DMG is increased even further. Otherwise, when she has no Bond of Life
    value, she just performs her lunging attack.\n\nIt is recommended to always use
    her lunging attack whenever she has at least 100% in Bond of Life value. Your
    total health bar represents 200% Bond of Life, so this 100% would be at the halfway
    point."

    Clorinde’s Burst is fairly straightforward. It is an AoE multi-hit attack that hits 5 times and also grants herself a large amount of Bond of Life based on her Burst Talent level. At Talent Level 7+, it grants enough Bond of Life to use her strongest lunging attack immediately.
