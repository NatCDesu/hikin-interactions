- title: __ENERGY RECHARGE REQUIREMENTS__
  description: |-
    Clorinde does not really need to build ER since bursting isn’t that much of a DPS gain. You should still Burst when it is up of course, but it is usually not worth building ER over more CRIT. The one exception is C4+ Clorinde, which at that point it is important to calculate your specific ER needs with the tools below.

    Clorinde’s ER requirements will vary based on your team and rotation. For a more accurate estimate, please use the Energy Recharge Calculator linked [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-vkmgp5n0bI9pvhUg110Aza3Emb2puLWdeoCgrxDlu4/copy).
