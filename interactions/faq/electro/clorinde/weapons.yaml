    Please read the [WFP Clorinde Mastersheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12uZ1moj3NEJXZo6MIf_jTVJ5Q-SM58y2FrO4K9SDAo0/edit?usp=sharing)

- title: "**Absolution (5-star)**"
  description: Her signature and best weapon. It is a significant personal damage
    increase that is comparable to her C1.

- title: "**Light of Foliar Incision (5-star)**"
  description: On the same launch banner as her signature weapon. It is one of
    the stronger 5-star options for her so it’s pretty hard to be upset
    about losing in the banner. Foliar is also a bit more versatile than
    her signature which is nice if you have multiple sword DPS units.

- title: "**The Black Sword (Battle Pass)**"
  description: Despite having a healing Passive which works with her BoL generation,
    the main reason this weapon is good on her is that it’s a good statstick that
    also grants high Normal Attack DMG%. At R1 it performs as well as Finale of the
    Deep R5. Once refined to R5 it starts creeping close to Foiliar’s DPS.

- title: "**Finale of the Deep (Free Craftable)**"
  description: Clorinde is the perfect user of this weapon, since the passive gives
    her a massive amount of ATK. While this weapon does not trump many of the 5-star
    swords it gets pretty darn close, which is very impressive considering it is **craftable**!
    Most people will be perfectly satisfied with sitting on this weapon instead of
    going for upgrades. If you are worried about missing out on damage, please look
    at the mastersheet for her weapon calcs to see how much of a difference in **team
    DPS** it is to sit on a free weapon; it is surprisingly low for a 5-star unit.
