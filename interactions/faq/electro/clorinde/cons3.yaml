    > *Increases the Level of Hunter's Vigil by 3.

    An increase in Clorinde's Elemental Skill level. Unfortunately, a large portion of her damage also comes from her A1 Passive, so this increase is less than a typical C3.

    > *When Last Lightfall deals DMG to opponent(s), DMG dealt is increased based on Clorinde's Bond of Life percentage. Every 1% of her current Bond of Life will increase Last Lightfall DMG by 2%. The maximum Last Lightfall DMG increase achievable this way is 200%.*

    Although this Constellation doesn’t seem like a large upgrade on sheets/sims, it does open the option to frontload her damage for quickly clearing a wave. At this level she has the option to go for one-shot nuke builds although our recommendation is still leaning towards Quickbloom teams due to how versatile they are.
