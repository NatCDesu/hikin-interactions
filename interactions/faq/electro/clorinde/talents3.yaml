    **Ascension 1 Passive: Dark-Shattering Flame**
  description: |-
    When a party member triggers an Electro reaction, Clorinde’s infused Normal Attacks and Burst gain an Additive DMG Bonus based on 20% of her ATK. This Additive DMG Bonus caps at 1800, stacks up 3 times and lasts 15s, with each stack having an independent duration.

    This means that any ATK above 3000 will not increase her damage significantly, since this Passive accounts for roughly half of her non-reaction damage.

- title: "**Ascension 4 Passive: Lawful Remuneration**"
  description: |-
    Clorinde gains 10% CRIT Rate for 15s after each fully-enhanced lunging attack, stacking up to 2 times, with each stack’s duration being independent from each other. Clorinde’s healing conversion to Bond of Life during her Night Vigil state increases as well, from 80% to 100% conversion.

    This passive can make it difficult to fit in a CRIT Rate weapon without overcapping since she also gains CRIT from her ascension levels.
