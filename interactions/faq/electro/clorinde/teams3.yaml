    ### Clorinde | Electro | Hydro | Anemo/Hydro
    **Ideal Setup: Clorinde | Furina | Yelan/Fischl| Kazuha**

    Although Clorinde is the first “good” Electro Taser driver character to come out, her Quickbloom and Aggravate teams usually utilizes her kit better. That being said, her function as a Taser unit is perfectly fine and the Hydro units that can pair with her are rather strong (Xingqiu/Yelan/Furina).

    __**Teammates**__

    <:hydro:1094545501493403709> **Hydro options:**
    - **Xingqiu/Yelan:** Function pretty similarly with Xingqiu being better defensively and Yelan offering more damage. They tend to prefer pairing up with a 2nd Hydro unit to reduce Energy costs.
    - **Furina:** Makes Clorinde much more durable while being able to buff all DPS characters in the party.

    <:electro:1094545575992623115> **Electro options:**
    - **Fischl:** A classic unit for Taser teams, always try to deploy Oz in between Clorinde’s gaps of field time.
    - **Beidou:** Good in 2+ target situations and provides interruption resistance and damage reduction.

    <:anemo:1094545726748508250> **Anemo options:**
    - **Kazuha:** Provides grouping and buffs.
    - **Sucrose:** Similar to Kazuha but with weaker grouping and smaller buffs.
    - **Jean/Sayu**: Can be used in Furina teams for faster Fanfare generation.
