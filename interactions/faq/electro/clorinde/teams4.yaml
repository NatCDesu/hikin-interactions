  description: "### Clorinde | Buffer | Buffer | Buffer or Anemo if no Chevreuse\n**Ideal
    Setup *(For higher invest players only)*: \nClorinde | Sara | Chevreuse | Xiangling**\n\nThis
    playstyle only really makes sense for people who are at least C2R1 on Clorinde
    since at her C0 base she is not doing enough personal damage even with buffers
    to shine. Even at this level of investment the other teams above generally perform
    better and have even higher ceilings for upgrades such as using C2 Nahida or Furina.\n\n__**Teammates**__\n\n<:flex:1094549077280169984>
    **Buffer options:**\n- **Sara C6:** Is able to buff Clorinde while not restricting
    her to a circle.\n- **Kazuha:** Offers grouping and Elemental DMG Bonus%.\n- **Chevreuse
    C6:** One of the few options for Electro and Pyro RES Shred that is not locked
    to Anemo units. Does have the restriction of forcing your whole team to be Pyro/Electro.\n-
    **Bennett:** His ATK buff can cap out Clorinde’s A1 Passive which is not ideal.
    A larger problem is that he forces Clorinde, a hyper-mobile character, to be constrained
    to a circle. His healing also does not really work with her since Clorinde’s self-healing
    usually keeps her healthy, so you can’t cheese out N2E’s with him.\n\n<:flex:1094549077280169984>
    **Flex options:**\n- **Xiangling:** Mainly only used with Chevreuse variants.\n-
    **Thoma:** Decent for interruption resistance and can slot into Chevreuse teams."
